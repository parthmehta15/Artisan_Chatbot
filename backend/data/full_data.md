# 10 Proven Strategies to Find B2B Leads
Updated On: July 29, 2024
10 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/how-to-find-b2b-leads)

Don’t worry, this isn’t another generic intro about how “B2B leads are the lifeblood of any business” and “essential for sales success.” 


You already know that lead gen is important. Whether you’re a bootstrapped startup founder wearing multiple hats or a junior marketer at an international SaaS enterprise, your company’s very existence hinges on your ability to drive consistent and high-quality leads. 


Lead gen will never be easy. But you can make it significantly less difficult by basing your strategy on the right mix of techniques and bolstering them with well-chosen tools.


If you’re new to B2B lead generation, this guide will help you build your system from the ground up. If you’re a seasoned pro, you’ll find tips and suggestions to further refine and develop your approach. 


Sound good? To quote perhaps the most overused ChatGPTism, let’s “dive” in. 


##What Is B2B Lead Generation?

B2B lead generation is the process of identifying and engaging potential customers. Lead generation focuses on the initial awareness or “top of funnel” phase of the customer acquisition journey. 


There are several categories of leads. Marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) and sales-qualified leads (SQLs) are the most important. A marketing-qualified lead is a lead who has shown enough interest in your product or service—such as by responding to an ad or reaching out for more information—to be seen as having a reasonable likelihood of becoming a customer. 


At this stage, lead generation ends and lead nurturing begins. Lead nurturing is usually the responsibility of the sales team (although marketing teams may play a role alongside sales reps). A lead transitions from an MQL to an SQL when they have been through the nurturing process and are ready to buy. 


Lead generation is important because it’s the foundation of any successful sales funnel. It’s directly tied to baseline metrics like revenue, growth and profitability. B2B companies with effective lead generation strategies generate [133% more revenue](https://intellistart.co.uk/what-is-lead-generation-and-why-is-it-important/) compared to “average” companies that don’t fully engage potential buyers.


##How to Find B2B Leads That Boost Your Business
Without further ado, let’s look at the strategies themselves. Keep in mind that the idea isn’t to apply everything blindly. Rather, you should find the right mix for your target audience and product. 


###1. Find B2B Leads via LinkedIn Sales Navigator 
LinkedIn has one of the most complete, most accurate B2B lead databases. [89% of B2B marketers](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-statistics/) use LinkedIn for lead generation, and 62% say its effective over the long term.



Here’s how to generate leads with LinkedIn Sales Navigator. 


- 
Purchase a paid LinkedIn plan if you don’t already have one. 


- 
Use advanced search filters to target specific industries, company sizes, job titles, etc. based on your ideal customer profile (ICP). 


- 
Use LinkedIn's InMail feature to reach out directly to B2B prospects and decision-makers with a personalized message that clearly outlines your value proposition. 


- 
Follow up, again keeping everything personalized. 



Here’s a sample template based on the three Cs (compliment, case study, call to action) of successful outreach: 


Hi {prospect name},


Love what you’re doing at {prospect company name}. I was particularly impressed by your {recent prospect company achievement). 


At {your company name}, we provide {your service}. We recently helped one of our clients achieve {client result). 


We’d love to do the same for you. Are you free for a quick call this week? 


And here’s what an example looks like in practice with Microsoft as an example:


Hi Bill,


Love what you’re doing at Microsoft. I was particularly impressed by your latest VR headset release. 


At Artisan, we provide fully automated, AI-driven lead gen. We recently helped one of our clients triple their VR sales. 



We’d love to do the same for you. Are you free for a quick call this week? 


###2. Start a Customer Referral Program
Research shows that referral programs are among the most effective low-cost lead-gen strategies, with [86% of companies](https://viral-loops.com/referral-marketing/statistics) that use referral programs experiencing growth. 


If you don’t already have a referral program, you’re potentially missing out on Everest-size mountains of inexpensive leads. 


Here’s how to launch a referral program:


- 
Decide on an attractive referral incentive. Incentivize existing customers to refer new leads by offering discounts, rewards, or bonuses. Offer an incentive to both the referrer and the recipient. 


- 
Build referral infrastructure. Create referral program landing pages and track referrals through your CRM. While there’s significant variability between industries, data shows that a referral rate (the percentage of your total sales that come from referrals) of [around 10%](https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/what-is-referral-rate-what-is-the-formula-and-why-it-is-important/) is healthy. 


- 
Contact existing customers. Foster strong relationships with customers to encourage advocacy and referrals. Include referral emails in your email onboarding sequences and newsletter broadcasts.


- 
Test and refine. You’re unlikely to create a perfect referral program right off the bat, and that’s OK. Continuous A/B testing of your incentives, landing pages, and email outreach ensures ongoing improvement. 



###3. Find and Reach Qualified Leads With AI Sales Tools
AI sales tools streamline the process of finding and reaching qualified leads through automated lead scoring, data enrichment, personalized outreach, and hands-off optimization. 


AI sales tools also allow salespeople to focus on high-value activities like pursuing the most promising potential leads, which is the key to improving conversion rates and, ultimately, revenue.


Let’s take the example of [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/), an advanced lead-gen AI tool, to see how you would prospect in this way:


- 
Define your ICPs in detail to lay the basis for personalization and segmentation. 


- 
Create outreach templates, allowing AI to add a high level of lead personalization. 


- 
Let Artisan consult its lead database of over 300 million leads to put together a highly relevant list of targets. 


- 
Use AI-based insights to improve your response and conversion rates with ongoing outreach optimization and lead scoring.



Tools like Artisan are powerful for two main reasons. 


First, they allow for a largely hands-off approach, with AI taking over many manual tasks such as outreach personalization and lead filtering. 


Second, they are excellent for scaling. The size of Artisan’s database and the unlimited capacity of its AI engine means you can ramp up your lead gen in a fraction of the time it might otherwise take.

Experience fully automated, intelligent outreach that fills your pipeline quicker than you can say “lead gen!”  [Get in touch now](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing). 


###4. Engage Prospects Through Social Media
LinkedIn is the [top platform for B2B](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1445198/leading-social-media-platforms-used-for-b2b-marketing/) marketing, with YouTube coming in second. Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are also powerful, pointing towards the need for an omnichannel approach. 



Here’s how to create content that hits those all-important engagement buttons:


- 
Understand the platform: The type of longer-form written content that works on LinkedIn isn’t going to fly with Instagram audiences familiar with snappy video shorts. Platform-specific expertise is a must for your marketing team. 


- 
Focus on value: Social media users are savvy. Always keep the question, “Where can I provide value?” at the forefront of your mind. Thought-leadership insights, original studies, and news commentary are all good contenders for content. Think in terms of your customers’ pain points. 


- 
Connect with influencers: Share and share alike. Connect with and redistribute the content of other influencers, widening your audience and opening the door to potential collabs. 


- 
Use hashtags: Yes, hashtags are still valuable. Use them appropriately and they can give your content a small lift. 


- 
Engage: There’s nothing that screams, “I don’t care,” than a comments section without any replies from the poster. Show your audience you value them by responding to their comments and shares. 


- 
Don’t be scared to sell: Being over salesy is one of the surest ways to alienate your audience. But there’s a risk of going too far in the opposite direction, too. Around one in every five posts can include a call to action. 


###5. Consider Using Web Scraping Tools to Find Qualified Leads
Web scraping has become something of a dirty phrase in digital marketing. This is perhaps understandable because of how open to all sorts of evil spammery it is.


However, scraping can be done ethically, safely, and legally. Artisan, which collects data that’s shared with consent, is one example of a company operating ethically in this space. 


Here are four tips to conduct web scraping safely: 


- 
Use tools like [Artisan](http://artisan.co), Octoparse, Import.io, and ParseHub to extract contact information from websites. You don’t need any technical expertise to do this. 


- 
Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines when scraping data. For example, GDPR applies in the EU. Generally speaking, third-party providers will take care of regulatory responsibilities. 


- 
Clean and verify scraped data to maintain accuracy and relevance. Ensuring the accuracy of data can have a significant effect on your outreach delivery rate. 


- 
Test the effectiveness of different databases. Not all databases are equal and there can be significant differences in lead quality and accuracy. Some databases are better suited to specific industries. 



###6. Leverage SEO-Focused Content Marketing to Attract Leads 
Companies with blogs produce an average of [67% more leads per month](https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic) than companies that don’t have active blogs. 


In addition, well-executed SEO strategies can drive an [ROI of up to 1000%](https://sagapixel.com/seo/seo-roi-statistics/). Not bad by any stretch of the imagination.


Here’s how to make SEO-based content marketing work for you:


- 
Diversify your strategy: Create high-quality, informative content in a range of formats. Short blog posts, long pillar articles, case studies, ebooks, and whitepapers all have a place. 


- 
Target “sweet spot” KWs: While it’s important not to overestimate the competitiveness of the keywords you can rank for, going for the easiest option isn’t always best, either. Find the sweet spot KWs you can rank for given your domain’s authority. 


- 
Put quality first: EEAT has become one of the most well-known Google acronyms among content marketers. It stands for Experience, Expertise, Authority and Trust. Prioritize these factors when creating content. 


- 
Take care of technical SEO: Keyword density, featured snippets, content length, meta descriptions, internal links—all are important for rankings. Content quality is vital. But don’t overlook the technicalities. 


- 
Tailor your CTA to the relevant stage of your funnel: A page with high buyer intent, like “Best lawyer to get me out of prison now”, should push visitors to book a call or buy a service immediately. Pages with lower buyer intent, such as “What's the difference between a divorce and criminal lawyer,” should have a softer call to action, such as the opportunity to download a free guide in exchange for an email. 


###7. Generate Leads by Re-Engaging Your Email List
Your email list likely contains at least some unengaged subscribers. These are potential customers, and it often doesn’t take much to reconnect. 


So, how can you turn uninterested subscribers into sizzling hot leads? Enter the re-engagement campaign…



Here’s a quick five-step process for re-engaging inactive subscribers: 


- 
Segment your inactive B2B subscribers where possible, such as by age, location, or sign-up date.


- 
Send them a tailored offer such as a voucher or free gift.


- 
Automate follow-up reminder emails.


- 
Nurture the leads who have shown initial interest with further personalized emails and offers. 


- 
Use a clear call to action prompting them to trial your product or book a call with the sales team. 


###8. Use Cold Outreach to Find New B2B Leads
Does the thought of cold outreach send a shiver down your spine? If you’re put off by the idea, you’re not alone. 


However, cold outreach, especially email, works. Studies show that the [average response rate of around 17%](https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-statistics/) for personalized emails of the kind Artisan provides is . 


Here are some key tips to help you get the most out of cold outreach: 


- 
Take a multi-channel approach: The best approaches leverage multiple channels, with email outreach, social media outreach, and cold calling all accounted for.


- 
Automate wherever possible: Cold outreach requires scale. As such, AI and automation tools can help to enhance efficiency by scheduling and automating email sequences and crafting personalized messages based on prospect data and behavior.


- 
Personalize, personalize, personalize: Personalization is crucial. You don’t need to hand-write every message with a fountain pen. A good template with ample space for your automation tool to add individual elements is more than enough.



A tool like Artisan is perfect for cold email automation. The AI functionality, unmatched by any competitors, allows for a level of personalization much greater than traditional if-then automations. 


###9. Host Webinars for B2B Sales Leads
Webinars have mahoosive (that’s the technical term) conversion rates, and they’re excellent for turning cold leads into hot ones. In fact, [73% of B2B marketers](https://www.hubilo.com/blog/webinar-benchmarks) say that webinars are their “most effective” lead gen strategy. 


Here are some tips for hosting next-level webinars:


- 
Ask your existing audience, which is likely a sample of your broader market, what webinar topics they’re interested in. 


- 
Always collect registration data to follow up with attendees afterward.


- 
Include a clear call to action at the end of webinars, whether to sign up to your service or book a sales call. 


- 
Make webinars available for a period after they’ve ended to overcome timezone constraints. 


- 
Repurpose webinar content into other formats like blog posts and infographics to extend reach.



Some marketers worry that webinars represent a complex technical challenge. A few years ago, this might have been true. However, with the prevalence of easy-to-use webinar software, this is no longer the case. 


###10. Optimize Website Landing Pages to Increase B2B Leads
When does a website visitor become a lead? 


We’re sure there are lots of technical business-school answers to this question. But we prefer a simpler working definition: a visitor becomes a lead when they pass on their contact details. 


Here are three tips for using landing pages to turn visitors into leads:


- 
Create dedicated landing pages for specific marketing campaigns and ads targeting B2B leads (there’s nothing worse than a landing page totally out of sync with an advert). 


- 
A/B test landing page elements such as headlines, CTAs, and forms to improve conversion rates on an ongoing basis. 


- 
Use analytics tools to identify and replicate your best landing pages and associated offers.


- 
Ensure that technical on-site elements like your page structure and navigation are easy to use. 


- 
Always include a clear, straightforward CTA on your landing pages, whether a download link for a lead magnet or the option to book a sales call. 


##Best Tools to Supplement Your B2B Lead Generation Strategies
Once you’ve got an ironclad marketing strategy, you need tools to help you execute. 


Most marketers rely on an integrated tech stack rather than a single tool. That said, the trend in recent years has been towards multifunctional all-in-one platforms rather than narrow “point” solutions. While you’ll have additional tools for supporting tasks, most of your sales prospecting will likely take place in a single app. 


We recommend that you try the different solutions on offer to get a sense of which one best fits your business. 


Here’s a quick overview of the top lead generation tools to get you started:

Now you know what’s on offer, let’s jump into detailed reviews of the leading Apollo alternatives and find the one that's the perfect fit for your business. 


##1. Artisan

Artisan is an AI-first, all-in-one outbound sales automation and lead gen platform. Unlike the other entries on this list, AI is baked right into the core of the software in a very nuanced and wide-reaching way. 


Artisan’s AI engine is a human-like “employee” called Ava. She’s a virtual business development representative (BDR) who can automate 80% of the outbound sales process and will get your first campaign up and running over the course of a 10-minute conversation. 


Ava puts together your ideal customer profile, prospects the Artisan database of over 300 million contacts, filters and enriches the leads, and crafts and sends bespoke email sequences.


You can also, of course, access features manually where appropriate and have full control over what’s automated.



###Key Features
- 
Baked-in AI engine. Artisan’s AI sales development representative (SDR), Ava, streamlines and improves every part of the outbound sales process, from campaign setup to the actual outreach itself. 


- 
Lead database. Apollo’s database has over 300 million leads across 200 countries with up-to-date and fully enriched lead data. 


- 
Web scraping. Ava collects data points from a wide set of sources, including company websites and social media like LinkedIn and Twitter. 


- 
Workflow replication. Already have successful outbound sales workflows? Excellent. Ava can replicate and automate them in Artisan by building a dedicated playbook for your target outreach and email sequences. 


- 
Email automation. Artisan’s email outreach tools are fully automated, with timezone tracking, translation, bounce testing, and dynamic send limits baked in. Send follow-up emails, receive notifications about interested leads, and manage responses via the intuitive email dashboard. 


- 
Email warmup. Built-in email warmup service ensures that your mailboxes are prepped and ready to go without fear of penalties. No need to pay for a dedicated third-party warmup service. 


- 
Analytics. You’ll have access to comprehensive data about your campaigns with metrics like lead response rate, mailbox health, most successful campaigns, and more. 



###Pricing
Artisan pricing varies based on the lead volume and customization required. However, you’ll get one-on-one onboarding, and there’s no charge until your campaign is firing on all cylinders (so you’re not worrying about idle time). 


For a pricing consultation and to learn how Ava can boost your sales enablement, reach out to Artisan’s sales team.


###Pros
- 
Uses active web scraping and AI enrichment to identify a wide range of lead data points including intent and technographic data


- 
Comprehensive platform for all aspects of sales outreach


- 
Automation for every stage of your outbound workflow


- 
Automates email writing based on successful email playbooks and emulation of true human style


- 
Built-in hallucination checks to prevent AI-related mistakes


- 
At the forefront of AI to create hyper-personalized research, enrichment, and outreach workflows


###Cons
- 
As an early-stage startup, some features are missing (though Artisan is growing very quickly, and new functionality is being added weekly)


- 
Expensive for smaller companies compared to more basic automation software


##2. ZoomInfo

ZoomInfo is a B2B sales intelligence and outreach platform that also provides a layer of engagement tools, such as web chat and web form optimization.


It’s aimed at B2B enterprises and boasts a solid database of B2B data. In addition to the desktop app, users can also take advantage of a Chrome extension for prospecting on the go. 


###Key features
- 
Customizable enterprise tools. Leverage APIs and data-as-a-service (DaaS) options to customize enterprise solutions. 


- 
Lead database. Access a large database of prospects with automated enrichment and segmentation.


- 
Integrations library. Integrate with many third-party platforms like AWS and Snowflake. 


- 
Automation. Automate email sequences and parts of the phone outreach process. 


###Pricing
Pricing isn’t publicly available. Users indicate that pricing is at the enterprise level and expensive compared to other providers. 


###Pros
- 
Large set of enterprise-level features, including APIs


- 
Interface is easy to configure and use


- 
A large set of integrations with third-party solutions


###Cons
- 
Analysis of user reviews indicates that the platform is expensive


- 
Limited AI functionality 


- 
There are many complaints about unresponsive customer service


##3. HubSpot Sales Hub

Ah, good ol’ HubSpot. It seems that nowadays, no software review is complete without HubSpot getting at least a passing mention. 


Sales Hub is a standalone solution (although it does, of course, integrate with the HubSpot CRM) and has pricing tiers that cater to the whole spectrum of business users, from solopreneurs to multinational enterprises. 


###Key features
- 
Sales engagement sequences. Build and automate email outreach sequences. 


- 
Lead scoring. Score and track the progress of your leads. 


- 
CRM integration. Integrate Sales Hub easily with your HubSpot CRM if you use it. 


###Pricing
Hubspot has three pricing tiers and a free plan. The “Starter” package is $20/month per user, the “Professional” package is $100/month per user, and the “Enterprise” package is $150/month per user. 


###Pros
- 
Integrates directly with the broader HubSpot CRM


- 
Includes a meeting scheduler and invoicing tools 


- 
Easy-to-use platform and large community   


###Cons
- 
No lead database 


- 
AI functionality is limited to writing emails


- 
Per-user pricing can quickly add up 


##4. LinkedIn Sales Navigator

LinkedIn Sales Navigator is one of the most popular sales prospecting tools, largely by virtue of the fact LinkedIn can advertise to virtually every sales professional on the planet. 


Automation features are limited, and, perhaps counterintuitively, its database is relatively small compared to other providers because it only provides access to individuals and companies with profiles. 


###Key features
- 
Lead database. Access a database of around 60 million LinkedIn users. 


- 
Intent tracking. Filter leads based on signals like job changes and profile visits. 


- 
Integrations library. Integrate with top CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce. 


###Pricing
Sales Navigator “Core” costs $99/month, and Sales Navigator “Advanced” costs $169.99/month. A custom plan with additional features is also available. 


###Pros
- 
Useful for manual LinkedIn outreach of warm prospects


- 
High-quality lead data 


- 
Integrates with the main CRMs


###Cons
- 
Small database


- 
Limited automation and AI functionality 


- 
Most advanced features require a custom plan


##5. Lusha

Lusha is a rising star in the sales prospecting space. It’s garnering a reputation as a solid source of email contact data—with rigorous email verification criteria—but has mixed reviews when it comes to phone numbers. 


###Key features
- 
Lead database: Prospect from a database of 50 million enterprise accounts, with many GDPR-compliant leads. 


- 
Intent filter. Track intent and lead readiness with behavioral data. 


- 
Workflow automation. Automate email sequences and lead identification. 


- 
LinkedIn browser extension. Prospect from LinkedIn while browsing. 


###Pricing
Lusha has two paid tiers in addition to free and custom plans. The “Pro” plan is $49/month per user, and the “Premium” plan is $79/month per user. 


###Pros
- 
Transparent pricing for smaller companies 


- 
Emphasis on GDPR-compliant data 


- 
Simple and intuitive platform


###Cons
- 
Phone data requires credits


- 
Few segmentation features


- 
Lack of AI functionality


##6. Seamless.AI

Seamless.AI places AI functionality at the core of its platform, using it to verify and enrich B2B contact data and lead lists and automate cold email outreach. 


It works on a lead credit basis, so there will be limits on how much outreach you can conduct if you opt for Seamless.AI. 


###Key features
- 
AI-enriched lead database. Access a large database of prospects with AI-enriched data. 


- 
Workflow automation. Send automated email outreach and follow-up with emails written by AI.


- 
Lead search engine. Search directly for leads using the prospect “real-time search engine.”


###Pricing
Seamless.AI offers a free trial with 50 credits. Contact sales to learn about pricing for the “Basic,” “Pro,” and “Enterprise” plans. User reviews indicate that pricing starts at approximately $150/month.  


###Pros
- 
Strong AI functionality


- 
Automation tools for email sequences


- 
Lead search engine for finding individual sales leads


###Cons
- 
Credit-based structure, which can restrict outreach


- 
Limited customer support on “Basic” plan


- 
Many advanced features like intent signals are only available on the “Pro” plan and above


##7. Hunter

Email is Hunter’s thing. It’s a good Apollo’s alternative but focused on near-exclusively email, with little additional lead data. 


While Hunter does have discovery and prospecting features, it’s better understood as an email finder rather than a sales outreach one. It’s a potential option for smaller businesses without complex prospecting requirements. 


###Key features
- 
Email search tool. Search for email addresses at target companies and run email verification. 


- 
Campaign automation. Run semi-automated email campaigns on the platform. 


- 
Integrations. Integrate with the most popular CRMs and use the browser extension to enhance prospecting. 


###Pricing
Hunter has a free plan with 25/searches per month. The “Starter” plan is $49.00/month, the “Growth” plan is $149/month, and the “Business” plan is $499/month. Hunter also has an enterprise tier. 


###Pros
- 
Good email data accuracy


- 
Unlimited users (limits are based on monthly searches)


- 
Browser add-on


###Cons
- 
No phone data


- 
Restrictions on the number of email searches per month


- 
Limited automation and AI features


##8. RocketReach

RocketReach has a colossal database of 700 million leads and a strong set of lead-generation automation features. 


That said, users have raised concerns about the quality of B2B email and direct dials. In addition, to access unlimited data, you need to subscribe to an annual plan. 


###Key features
- 
Leads database. Access a huge database of 700 million leads.


- 
Intent signals. Tailor outreach to target individuals with strong buyer intent. 


- 
API. Rocket offers an API for enterprise use. 


###Pricing
RocketReach offers a range of pricing tiers from $39.00/month (individual plan) to $349/month per user (team plan). You’ll need to purchase an annual plan for unlimited lead data. 


###Pros
- 
Large lead database


- 
Well-priced individual plans


- 
Email automation


###Cons
- 
The database is of questionable quality based on user reviews


- 
Forces you to purchase the annual plan to unlock features


- 
A limited number of integrations


##9. Lead411

Lead411 bills itself as the only unlimited B2B data prospecting tool. That’s not quite true—other services don’t cap the amount of lead data you can access—but it does have a pretty sizable database of over 450 million. 


Lead411 has added outreach tools for running email campaigns directly to the platform and also offers intent data on its premium plans. 


###Key features
- 
Unlimited data access. Gather as much lead data (emails and phone numbers) as you want without any limits. 


- 
Intent signals. Track intent signals and score B2B leads (only available on the higher-tier plan). 


- 
Outreach management. Run email campaigns on the platform, including SMS outreach.


###Pricing
Lead411’s “Basic Plus Unlimited” plan costs $99/month per user. Intent data is available on the annual “Pro” and “Unlimited” packages. Contact sales for pricing. A free trial is available. 


###Pros
- 
Large database with unlimited access


- 
Integrations with top CRMs


- 
Chrome extension for prospecting while browsing


###Cons
- 
Expensive compared to other Apollo alternatives


- 
Small number of integrations compared to other tools


- 
Intent data is not available on all plans


##10. Pipedrive

Pipedrive is a tool for running email campaigns and outreach workflows rather than for prospecting. 


It’s an excellent enterprise-level sales enablement platform. But if you’re looking for fresh leads, you’ll need an additional service that provides access to a database. 


###Key features
- 
Outreach management. Manage leads and run segmented email campaigns.


- 
Analytics. Access granular data about your campaigns across a range of metrics like revenue targets and sales team performance. 


- 
Large library of integrations. Integrate Pipedrive with your whole tech stack. 


###Pricing
Pipedrive offers several pricing plans, beginning at $14/month per user and ending at $99/month per user. All plans have free trials. 


###Pros
- 
Powerful enterprise-level sales enablement platform


- 
Growing AI functionality 


- 
Lots of integrations


###Cons
- 
It doesn’t provide access to a lead database


- 
Slightly convoluted pricing structure


- 
Intuitive and well-designed interface


##It’s time to say goodbye…
We get it. Wading through sales enablement platforms is hard work. Learning to navigate different dashboards is time-consuming and frustrating. But it is worth it. 



The hours you devote to picking the right tool—one that’s ideally suited to your and your team’s specific needs—is time well spent. Leads are the lifeblood of your business. And the tools you use will make a big difference. 


As for parting advice, we recommend taking full advantage of free trials and demos. Oh, and don’t forget to give Artisan a test drive. We know you’ll love it.


##Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is Apollo.io?


Apollo is a lead prospecting and outreach platform. Its user base has grown substantially over the last several years and is now a market leader. Its top features include an extensive lead database and outreach automation tools. 


Why consider alternatives to Apollo.io?


Alternatives to Apollo may offer features better suited to your needs. Apollo’s competitors sometimes perform better in terms of database size, AI functionality, ease of use, and pricing, to name some examples. 


Which tool is best for small businesses?


Hunter, RocketReach, and Lusha all have pricing tiers that will appeal to small businesses. HubSpot Sales Hub is also a good option but doesn’t provide lead data. 


How to evaluate sales automation tools?


To evaluate sales automation tools, take full advantage of free trials, check the quality of the lead database by conducting your own searches, check user reviews, and don’t hesitate to contact support with questions.

#11 Effective B2B Sales Channels to Drive Growth and Revenue
Updated On: July 29, 2024
15 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-sales-channels)

Gone are the days when brands tried to build their presence all over the place, jumping on every opportunity to boost awareness and attract leads.


Today, less is more. Successful founders and leaders know this mantra well and strive to instill it in their teams.


However, what should be a freeing feeling of narrowing your focus often adds an extra challenge for sales teams: Which channels should you focus on?


With so many options for online and offline sales channels, it’s overwhelming to decide where to invest your time and resources. To help you make this decision, we’ve reviewed eleven channels that have the highest potential for B2B sales teams. 


##The Importance of Choosing the Right B2B Sales Channels
Cold outreach or digital advertising? Conferences or email marketing? Choosing the right sales channels isn’t just about maximizing ROI; it may actually define your company’s long-term success. Here’s how.



###Building Awareness With the Right Audience
The buyer’s journey is never linear, especially in B2B. Often, the sales process begins long before a customer responds to your first sales email. 


It starts when they first discover your company and remember the information. This could be through a cold outreach message they never replied to, a social media ad, or your speech at an industry conference. If the channel is right and puts you in front of the right audience, it will boost your sales performance in the long term.


###Efficient Lead Generation and Sales Growth
Choosing the right sales channels will inevitably help you grow faster and scale more easily. You won’t have to spend hours convincing irrelevant leads that your solution is right for them (when it’s not).


Say, you might drive tons of leads with a social media ad offering freemium access to your enterprise-level solution. Thousands in ad spend and hundreds of sales team hours—only to get a handful of prospects that convert into paying customers. But if you focused your resources on outbound sales, you could generate fewer but more qualified leads and achieve higher conversion rates.


###Personalized Interactions With Potential Customers
Your sales channels should help you build rapport with your prospects.


Some channels, such as social selling or cold outreach, provide a direct means to interact with customers. Others, like webinars and blogs, offer a platform to foster a sense of connection with your audience. Whichever you choose, these platforms are where you can build trust with potential customers and make an impression before diving into sales calls.


###Better Understanding of Your Target Audience
You may not discover the right sales channel on your first attempt. However, you will gain a deeper understanding of your ideal customers.


Each channel allows you to gather insights about your target audience: their preferences, online behavior, and what influences their decisions. Plus, many channels provide useful data and analytics, giving you deeper insights into their behaviors.


With this data, you can identify what works best and optimize not only sales but your entire business strategy for maximum impact.


##11 Effective B2B Sales Channels You Should Explore
So yes, choosing the right B2B sales channel goes beyond reaching your sales KPIs. It's your chance to build an engine that connects your brand with the right audience and fosters long-term relationships for the future.



With that in mind, let’s walk you through the top channels you should consider for your sales strategy.


###1. Direct Sales and Cold Outreach
What if, instead of spending your budget on a scattershot approach (sorry, inbound sales), you invested it in reaching your exact audience?


This “channel” has been here for ages. Ever since early humans started to exchange food for other valuable resources, humanity has been hooked on direct sales.


The approach has remained largely unchanged until AI revolutionized it. Not long ago, an SDR had to spend hours identifying and prioritizing potential customers, carefully crafting and sending outreach messages. Today, things are different.


Outbound sales, a.k.a. direct sales, is no longer the most resource-intensive task for your sales team. AI-powered outbound sales software has made this channel more accessible to everyone—you don’t need a large SDR team to make it work anymore.


How does it work? AI SDRs take over the lead research and cold outreach processes, handing over qualified leads to your pipeline. All you need is a strong understanding of customer personas—AI SDRs will do the rest.



For instance, Artisan’s SDR Ava learns about your ideal customer profile (ICP), searches her database of over 300 million contacts in over 200 countries, and creates an outreach campaign to reach the top-matching prospects with highly personalized messages.


The result? Ava automates 80% of the outbound sales process. She allows you to build a scalable direct selling machine on autopilot—all without increasing overhead. [Try Ava today](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).


Our verdict is that direct selling and cold outreach are a must-have channel for B2B businesses. Whether you combine it with inbound sales techniques or not, it should be the core of your sales strategy.


###2. Social Sales on LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a powerhouse for B2B social selling. As this channel doesn’t need long introductions, let’s dive into how you can effectively integrate it into your sales strategy.


There are many ways to sell on LinkedIn, both outbound and inbound. They include:


- 
Manual lead generation: identifying leads based on criteria like job title, company size, and industry, then initiating contact through personalized messages on the platform.


- 
LinkedIn Sales Navigator: using LinkedIn’s premium tool to access advanced audience filters and automate lead tracking.


- 
Brand building: developing a strong personal or company brand on LinkedIn through strategic marketing efforts to build trust with potential customers and attract inbound leads.


- 
AI-powered automation: employing automation tools like [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/products/sales-automation) or Apollo to discover and export qualified leads from LinkedIn and start cold outreach via email.



But before jumping in, ensure your audience is active on LinkedIn. While it's particularly popular in the tech sphere, other industries are often less represented on the platform.


###3. Conferences and Networking Events
Direct selling allows you to connect with your prospects face-to-face, and so do offline events. 


Attending trade shows and industry conferences, whether as a speaker, exhibitor, or attendee, is a great strategy for promoting your brand and starting to sell your products or services with minimal investment.


Here’s how you can find relevant events in your niche and turn them into your sales channel:


- 
Follow top voices in your industry on social media platforms (LinkedIn is a good place to start). Check their feeds for the past year to see where they have been speaking—these events are likely to recur soon.


- 
Focus on small-scale events. However enticing a major conference like Web Summit might sound, you’ll find more success at niche meetups.


- 
Sign up as an attendee first. You’ll have the opportunity to connect with other participants and discuss business directly, without the pressure of preparing and delivering a speech.


- 
Research other attendees. If the event page displays who’ll be present at the event (also common on LinkedIn), look into the attendees’ profiles to identify your potential buyers in advance.


- 
Prepare an elevator pitch. Be ready to present the most important information about your business in about 30 seconds when people ask what you do.


- 
Have the helpful resources at hand. Ensure you have easy access to all the links or contact information you might need to share.



And remember that, unlike typical outbound sales, promoting your company at networking events requires a more subtle approach. Avoid greeting people with a direct sales pitch.


Note: This approach makes sense if you sell high-ticket products or services. If you sell basic subscription-based software, applying as a speaker will bring you much more exposure and potential leads.


###4. Webinars and Online Industry Events
[Seventy-seven percent of surveyed marketers](https://corp.kaltura.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-State-of-virtual-events-2024.pdf) say virtual events have a more positive impact on lead generation than in-person events. Of course, this is only true when you run your own event or join one as a co-host or sponsor.


If you aim to generate qualified leads at scale, webinars and podcasts are the way to go. 


Here are a few tips to plan a virtual event as a lead capture initiative:


- 
Understand who you want to reach. Be specific.


- 
Develop an agenda that is both relevant to your target market and aligned with your value proposition.


- 
Select a reliable platform that supports interactive features like Q&A, polls, and chat to engage your audience.


- 
Build a landing page with a lead capture form.


- 
Use email marketing, social media, and your website to spread the word and encourage registrations.



That being said, webinars as a demand and lead generation tool don’t work for everyone. If you lack the resources to develop high-quality content, engage subject matter experts, and run a promotional campaign, it will simply become another hyped-up channel in your arsenal that fails to deliver the desired results.


###5. SEO and Content Marketing
Known as digital marketing tactics in the first place, search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing are also the primary channels to drive inbound leads. 


[Ninety-six percent of consumers](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report) research their options before talking to a sales rep. So, having a website should be a no-brainer for every business. However, there's a catch.


Here's the thing: just having a website and sprinkling it with keywords won't cut it. To get your website noticed in a competitive field, it takes months or even years of continuous effort to create, optimize, measure, and so on.


So, before you invest your time and money into growing your company website, ask yourself:


- 
How competitive is your industry? Use an SEO tool to check the difficulty of your target keywords. If it's above 50%, you're in a tough crowd.


- 
Do you have the resources to hire an SEO expert or manage a team?


- 
Are your competitors showing up in search results? If they're not, why not?



If your industry is highly competitive and you're ready to commit to the long haul, investing in SEO can pay off big time.


In a less competitive niche, spending a few hours optimizing your site with relevant keywords and content can get you on the first page of search results within weeks. If it ends up driving qualified leads, you've successfully identified a valuable sales channel for your business. If not, there's no harm done.


###6. Email Marketing
Email marketing is [the most implemented](https://info.sagefrog.com/2020-marketing-mix-report) marketing tactic and is also a highly effective sales channel.


Think of it as a consent-based form of cold outreach. Instead of cold-calling or sending unsolicited messages, email marketing reaches potential customers who have willingly signed up to receive communication from your brand.


It’s often a natural next step after lead generation efforts where leads aren’t yet ready for direct sales pitches.


Here’s how you can make it work:


- 
Collaborate with the marketing team. Work closely to align your marketing strategy with sales efforts.


- 
Build a quality email list. Gather contacts through sign-ups, subscriptions, or opt-ins on your website and other channels.


- 
Segment your audience. Group your subscribers based on demographics, interests, or behaviors.


- 
Craft compelling content. Create engaging and relevant content, including promotions, educational resources, and product updates.


- 
Create email sequences. Use email automation tools to set up workflows that will trigger relevant emails based on your rules. 



The part where you align with your marketing department is particularly important for the success of this campaign. Whether you let them handle it or you work together on every step, your alignment will help turn potential leads into actual sales faster.


###7. Online Advertising
Need to gain traction fast? Paid media is [a top choice](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/paid-marketing-channels) among SaaS businesses. 



But which platform should you choose: LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, or another channel? The answer to this question lies in understanding your audience.


For instance, GoogleAds are perfect for a B2B brand looking to capture prospects actively searching for solutions or services. It’s like using a shortcut to SEO—your landing pages will appear at the top of search results when people are searching for relevant keywords.


If your sales strategy requires creating awareness first, channels like LinkedIn or Facebook are better choices. Now, the decision hinges on whether your audience is active on these platforms and your budget (note that LinkedIn Ads are more expensive).


###8. Affiliate Programs 
Whether you already have an extensive customer base or not, an affiliate program is a way to accelerate new customer acquisition.


An affiliate program, also known as a referral program, lets you promote and sell your products or services through your loyal customers and partners—or anyone willing to earn a commission on a sale.


While it does involve sharing a small part of your profit (usually 2% to 15%, depending on your offer's cost) with a third party, it’s one of the least resource-intensive sales channels. In some cases, especially where sales depend on word of mouth, it’s also the most cost-effective strategy.


You can either self-host your affiliate program, tracking sales and managing payouts yourself, or use a third-party affiliate platform to host your program. Using a third-party platform requires minimal effort to set up the program and partner conditions, and it handles tracking and managing the program for you.


The best part is that affiliate platforms often include an online marketplace where potential partners can find you.


###9. Trade Shows
Exhibiting your product or service at trade shows is a great way to raise awareness and engage in meaningful face-to-face conversations with your prospects. It’s actually one of the [top three marketing investment](https://info.sagefrog.com/2020-marketing-mix-report) priorities for B2B companies. 


In the B2B world, these shows are often part of major conferences. They attract attendees who are exploring offerings without much purchase intent. This makes trade shows especially effective for entering new markets.


###10. E-Commerce Channels
Do you sell physical products to B2B customers? You can increase your reach and drive sales with the following e-commerce channels: 


- 
Wholesale B2B platforms. Platforms like Alibaba connect business-to-business (B2B) suppliers and distributors looking to invest in wholesale products. 


- 
Niche-specific marketplaces. Distribution channels like ThomasNet offer a more narrow focus and are designed for procurement professionals in specific categories.


- 
General e-commerce platforms. You can create your own online storefront with platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce. They offer dedicated functionality to build buyer portals, manage invoicing, process payments, and other critical features for B2B sellers.



###11. Partnering With Consulting and Professional Services
Maybe you don’t need thousands of customers. Perhaps you only need a few large clients who deliver services to their own customers and need your product to do it effectively.


Here’s how to use partnerships to grow your business:


- 
Look for large agencies and established consultants in your niche. Search LinkedIn and industry marketplaces to find potential partners.


- 
Research their tech stacks. Find a point of contact within the organization and understand their current pain points with the solutions they use.


- 
Create special discounts or pricing plans for these partners. The potential business they bring in will far outweigh the cost of these discounts.


- 
Be ready to support them extensively. Large clients may require custom solutions and account management. Are you ready for it?




Another way to use partnerships to drive sales is by having them resell your product. If your product complements their services, they might be interested in selling it to their customers.


For instance, if you offer CRM software for jewelry brands, a jewelry marketing agency might want to transition their clients from legacy systems to your more user-friendly option.


##Choosing the Right B2B Sales Channels for Your Business
Haven’t decided yet which of these channels will fit your strategy best? This process will help you make an informed decision: 



###1. Map Out Your Buyer’s Journey
The buyer journey is your prospects’ path to purchase. Your task is to put the “traffic signs” at the right points to direct them toward the shortest path.


You likely have several customer personas, each with distinct buyer journeys. Follow this process to map out the buyer’s journey for each persona:


- 
Understand the role of your persona in the company. Are they an influencer, user, or decision-maker?


- 
Determine where each persona enters your sales funnel. Are they actively searching for a solution, or do you need to build problem awareness?


- 
Outline all interactions potential clients have with your brand, from initial contact to purchase and beyond. Which interactions should be handled by the sales team?


- 
Break down the journey into stages such as awareness, consideration, decision, and post-purchase. What stage does each touchpoint correspond to?




You’ve just created a basic buyer’s journey map. If you already have historical data at hand, this process will be even smoother.


###2. See What Similar Businesses Are Doing for Sales
You know your customers; now you need to know your close competitors.


Are they actively building their presence on LinkedIn? Are they investing in paid ads? Are they participating in trade shows?


Take note of their strategies and consider trying them yourself. If these methods work for your competitors, they will likely work for you too.


###3. Evaluate the Channel’s Potential for Your Goals
Well, you can't do everything your competitors do at once. You need to prioritize your initiatives. 


But how? Here’s the answer:


- 
Be specific with your current objectives. Are you building brand awareness, generating qualified leads, or increasing high-ticket sales?


- 
Turn to your buyer’s journey. Which sales channels align with your business goals and drive prospects along the shortest path to achieving them?




Focus on what drives the biggest impact on your goals at the moment. 


###4. Continue to Analyze and Optimize
As you implement your chosen channels, you’ll likely uncover discrepancies between your hypotheses and reality—and that's okay.


What's not okay is sticking with channels that aren't delivering results. Monitor your performance metrics and don’t hesitate to adjust your approaches or stop using the channels that show no positive results within a few months.


###5. Unlock the Full Potential of Your Sales Channels With AI
Like it or not, your competition is already implementing AI into their workflows. 


In fact, as many as [63% of sales leaders](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report) say AI helps them stay competitive in their industry. AI allows you to maximize the potential of your sales team and offer more personalized customer experiences—no wonder it’s a priority for most sales teams.


Here are some ideas for how you can augment your sales channels with AI:


- 
Hire AI SDRs to hand over cold outreach and generate more qualified leads, faster. [Try Ava now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).


-

-

#What is B2B Outbound Sales? Techniques and Tools for Growth
Updated On: July 31, 2024
15 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-outbound-sales)

Love them or hate them, B2B outbound sales strategies are fundamental for thriving B2B companies—and for a good reason. 


The B2B buyer journey is often a long, multi-touch process requiring buy-in from multiple stakeholders.


While inbound sales techniques allow B2B companies to attract potential buyers, inbound strategies alone can't take prospects from the beginning to the end of a complex sales journey—you need outbound to make that happen. 


However, complex sales cycles aren't the only reason B2B companies use outbound. It's also what the buyers want. 


- 
Recent research shows that [71% of buyers](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/when-do-buyers-want-to-talk-to-sellers-the-time-is-now) actually want salespeople to reach out when they're looking for solutions. 



B2B outbound sales enable companies to quickly target high-value prospects and key decision-makers and foster those connections until the deal is closed. 


Unfortunately, in the age of call screening, spam filters, and social media blocking, getting a hold of your prospects isn't easy. It's also time-consuming and resource-draining. 



- 
No wonder [52% of outbound marketers](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/#:~:text=14.-,Outbound%20Sales%20Statistics,prior%20to%20making%20a%20call.) say their current efforts are ineffective. 



In this guide, we'll examine some common outbound sales channels and the benefits of using outbound techniques. We'll also share some strategies to help you level up your B2B outbound sales strategies. 


##What is Outbound Sales?
So, what is outbound sales, and how do it differ from inbound sales? 


- 
Outbound sales is a proactive sales approach where salespeople identify leads and initiate contact via email, cold calling, or direct messages. 



Outbound sales are all about finding and converting leads quickly – which is super valuable since, according to HubSpot, [74% of companies](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=11361899.426d6d3a92ea56dcf2cf0e90bfead9e7.1720787822260.1720787822260.1720802553571.2&__hssc=11361899.1.1720802553571&__hsfp=1809682446) say converting leads in their CRM into paying customers is their top priority. 


- 
Inbound sales take a more passive approach. Despite its name, inbound sales is more of a marketing function focusing on attracting prospects via social media, content marketing, and search engine optimization. It encourages those prospects to engage with the company when they're ready.  


If the differences are still a bit blurry, here are some key differences between the two:


- 
Who makes the first move – In outbound sales, the sales rep makes the first move, but in inbound sales, the prospects tend to reach out first. 


- 
Time to results – Outbound sales are excellent for quick results, whereas inbound sales are best for gradual growth. 


- 
Prospect targeting – B2B outbound sales are all about precisely targeting particular market segments, while inbound sales involve more broad targeting methods.


- 
Primary tactics – Outbound sales tactics include cold emailing, cold calling, DMs, direct mail, and networking. Inbound sales tactics include social media posts, SEO, blogs, eBooks, and webinars.


- 
The costs – Inbound sales usually cost more to get started but less to keep going than outbound sales. That's because outbound sales traditionally cost more due to the high price of talent and tools (though this is changing with the arrival of [AI BDRs, like Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).)  



So, which is better for your organization? Neither—they're both essential functions for healthy B2B companies. 


Inbound sales build a strong pipeline of engaged prospects, while outbound sales ensure you don't miss any opportunities by targeting high-value accounts that can drive significant growth. By integrating both, you maximize your chances of converting and hitting your KPIs.


##4 Common B2B Outbound Sales Channels for Lead Generation
B2B outbound sales are all about generating leads to pitch and close. Here are some of the most common [B2B sales channels](https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-sales-channels).   


###Cold Calling
Cold calling involves calling prospects who haven't expressed prior interest in your products or services. While many sales reps overlook making sales calls, they shouldn't because, according to recent data, [57% of C-Level and VP-Level buyers](https://www.close.com/blog/39-shocking-stats-that-will-change-the-way-you-sell) prefer to connect on the phone. 


How to be successful: Success in cold calling depends on preparation, understanding the prospect's needs, and delivering a compelling value proposition. Generally, having a sales script and a clear goal for each call is important. For example, the goal of the first call may be pre-qualifying the prospect, understanding their key pain points, and taking notes about them in your CRM so that you're better prepared to close on the second or third call. 


###Cold Emails 
Cold emails are unsolicited emails sent to potential leads to introduce your business. Generally, cold emails are sent in sequences—or multiple emails sent at specific, pre-determined intervals. However, they can also be one-off messages sent with the goal of initiating contact.  



How to be successful: Effective cold emails are personalized, concise, and offer clear value. They should have a strong subject line since [69% of email recipients](https://optinmonster.com/101-email-subject-lines-your-subscribers-cant-resist/#:~:text=or%20ignore%20it.-,Why%20Is%20a%20Good%20Email%20Subject%20Line%20Important%3F,break%20your%20email%20marketing%20campaigns.) send emails to spam based only on their headline! They should also have a tailored message and a clear call to action. Automation tools can help manage and scale these campaigns. 


Want to automate your outbound? With our [AI BDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent), you can launch your campaign to targeted prospects in minutes and avoid spam filters with mailbox health monitoring, placement tests, email warmup, and more. 


###Social Selling
Social selling is an approach that utilizes social media platforms to connect with and nurture potential leads. LinkedIn is particularly powerful for B2B social selling, enabling connections with decision-makers and industry leaders. 


How to be successful: Every niche and platform has its own eccentricities, but, in general, sales professionals can build relationships with potential clients by sharing valuable content, engaging in conversations, and demonstrating expertise. Influencer marketing and partnerships may also be beneficial. 


###Networking Events & Webinars 
Networking events, like industry conferences, trade shows, and local meetups, are excellent opportunities to meet potential customers face-to-face, build relationships, and gather insights. 


Webinars allow you to reach a broad online audience, highlight your expertise, and establish thought leadership to a broad audience. 


How to be successful: Preparation is key for in-person events. Reach out to prospects before events to schedule a time to chat. Bring your business cards, but more importantly, be ready to network. Remember to show genuine interest and try to connect with people. In other words, don't go straight for the pitch. Instead, focus on connecting and making positive impressions with potential clients. 


If you're hosting a webinar, be sure to provide value to the attendees. If prospects feel like they were reeled into a webinar just to become a lead in your sales funnel, it'll leave a bad taste in their mouths. Think of it as an introduction to who your company is, and do your best to make sure it's a good first impression. 


If you're attending a webinar, come with questions to ask and be a vocal and active contributor. It's much harder to connect and make an impression with online events, so plan how to make your mark. 


##B2B Outbound Sales Benefits 
What makes B2B outbound sales particularly powerful? Here are some of the key benefits


###Target the Right Audience 
Outbound sales let you directly target your ideal audience. Instead of waiting for prospects to find you, you can reach out to those who fit your customer profile. Whether you buy leads, use a database, or scrape the web for prospects – with outbound sales, you can laser-focus on the types of companies that are the right fit for your offer. 


This focused approach boosts the chances of conversion because you're actually targeting the right prospects. More importantly, though, it maximizes the sales teams' efforts. Outbound sales enable companies to zero in on their target audience, saving time and energy while boosting results. 


###Personalized Outreach 
Outbound sales enable personalized outreach and allow you to tailor your message to your prospect's specific needs – and there are few things more powerful than a highly targeted message.  



Research has shown that companies that excel at personalization have [40% more revenue](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying) than their competitors who don't. Additionally, personalized messages have been proven to have a greater response rate than messages that don’t.

###Shorten Sales Cycle 
Outbound sales can accelerate the sales cycle. By initiating contact, you can move prospects through the sales funnel faster. You aren't waiting for them to make the first move (or take the next one). 


With outbound sales, you can address objections, provide information, and guide prospects toward a purchase more efficiently than trying to drive them through the process with inbound techniques alone. 


###Boost Inbound Marketing 
Inbound and outbound sales shouldn't be competing with one another. Instead, they should work in tandem, helping move prospects through the buyer journey. 


While it's easy to see how inbound leads and strategies like content marketing and SEO can help outbound, it's not always as easy to see how outbound can also help inbound teams. However, direct interactions with prospects provide valuable insights that can improve your content and strategies. Outbound efforts also drive traffic to your inbound channels, which increases overall engagement and visibility.


##6 Strategies for Successful B2B Outbound Sales 
While every company's B2B outbound sales strategy will vary based on its specific team, goals, and needs, every successful strategy includes six basic steps. 


###1. B2B Outbound Prospecting
Prospecting is simply the process of finding and engaging with potential customers. However, when doing B2B outbound sales, you obviously can't just pick up the phone book and start dialing random numbers. 



Instead, you have to get really good at sales prospecting, which starts by identifying your ideal customer profile (ICP). An ICP is a detailed description of the type of customer that would benefit the most from your product or service. 


To identify your ICP, you can start by analyzing your current customers and identifying common characteristics among your best customers, considering factors like:


- 
Industry: Which sectors do your best customers belong to?


- 
Company Size: What is the employee count or revenue range of your ideal customers?


- 
Location: Are your best customers concentrated in specific geographical areas?


- 
Challenges: What common problems or pain points do your best customers face that your solution addresses?



Creating a well-defined ICP helps you focus your outbound sales efforts on prospects most likely to convert and makes it much easier to build a prospect list. 


Once you know who your ICP is, you can use web scraping tools, lead databases, or tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator or the [AI BDR, Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent), to build a prospect list. 


Of course, not every prospect you find will be a perfect match. So, take some time to read and evaluate each prospect to ensure they're a good fit for your product or service before pouring tons of resources into reaching out.  


###2. Outreach Qualified Leads
Once you've got a strong list of potential customers, it's time to start the outreach process, and spoiler alert: generic messages won't cut it. To optimize your conversion rates, you need to personalize your outreach to address each person's specific needs and challenges. 


To personalize, you'll have to do some basic research on the prospect's business to uncover contact information and other details like:


- 
The company's industry 


- 
The prospect's name


- 
The company name


- 
Recent accolades 


- 
The pain points the company is experiencing



Then, you'll want to highlight all these things in your outreach. 


It's also important to choose the right channel for reaching out since different channels can be more effective for certain industries and instances. For example, if your ICP is a technology startup, you might focus on LinkedIn since [82% of B2B marketers](https://www.intelusagency.com/blog/linkedin-b2b-lead-generation) agree it's the best channel for B2B lead generation.  


When planning your outreach strategy for your outbound sales team, you also need to develop a strategy for bypassing gatekeepers. 


- 
Gatekeepers are the receptionists or assistants who often screen communications for decision-makers. 



Things like building rapport with the gatekeeper and using multiple channels (email, social media, calls) can maximize your chances of getting through. 



Ava is an AI BDR who automates 80% of the outbound sales process and can be set up with a 10-minute conversation. Ava creates the user's ICP, prospects with her database of over 270M contacts, does lead research, and crafts & sends highly bespoke email sequences. Want to [give her a spin](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)?


###3. Qualification and Needs Assessment
Once you've engaged a prospect, the next step is to schedule a meeting to qualify the prospect and learn more about them. 


For this first call, be upfront about what prospects should expect by establishing a clear agenda ahead of time. This can go a long way towards establishing your expertise and building trust. 


Your primary goal should be to find the specific challenges and pain points the prospect is facing so you can ensure they're the right fit and better tailor a sales pitch for their unique needs and goals. 


During the discovery call: 


- 
Ask open-ended questions to encourage the prospect to elaborate on their issues and actively listen to their answers. 


- 
Take notes and ask follow-up questions to gain deeper insights. Try to uncover as much about the decision-making process early on as possible.


- 
Gently probe for budget information to ensure your solution aligns with their financial capabilities. Ask questions like: "What kind of budget do you have allocated for this project?" to get a sense of their financial constraints. 


- 
Identify the key decision-makers within the organization. This can be done by asking, "Who else should be involved in this conversation?" or "Who will be making the final decision?"



Keep in mind you shouldn't try to close them during this call. On average, it takes [18 calls to connect](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics) with a potential buyer and five additional follow-up calls to actually close the deal. 


Taking the time to thoroughly qualify prospects and conducting a detailed needs assessment enables you to focus your efforts on leads with the largest potential to convert, saving time and resources while setting the stage for a successful sales engagement.


###4. Value Proposition and Presentation
It may take several calls with several different stakeholders to get to this point, but once you get the opportunity to do a formal pitch – it's important to be prepared. 


Start by preparing a personalized presentation highlighting how your product or service addresses the specific challenges and pain points discussed during the discovery call. 


For the best results: 


- 
Use success stories and social proof, such as case studies and testimonials, to demonstrate the tangible benefits and results your solution has provided to similar companies.


- 
Try to handle objections confidently and effectively. Be prepared to address common concerns and questions and provide clear, concise responses that reinforce the value of your offering. 


- 
Listen and respond to objections. Like in the discovery call, it's important to listen to the prospect's objections, understand their underlying concerns, and tailor your responses to alleviate those worries.


- 
Use visuals, like slides, infographics, and videos, to make your points more compelling and easier to understand. 


- 
Encourage questions and discussions throughout the presentation to keep the prospect interested and to address any issues in real-time.



By personalizing your pitch and confidently handling objections, you can ensure your presentation resonates with your prospects and moves them closer to a purchasing decision.


###5. Negotiation and Closing the Deal
This is the stage in the B2B outbound sales process where your sales skills really come into play. There's usually a bit of persuasion, negotiation, and lots of persistence. 


It's best to strive for win-win negotiations where both parties feel like they're gaining value. Make sure you clearly communicate the benefits of your solution and be prepared to discuss pricing, terms, and any potential adjustments. 



It's important to be flexible during this phase, but it's equally important to stand firm on the value your product or service provides. Be sure to outline clear next steps to keep the momentum going. Your prospects should always know how to move forward with the deal. 


After reaching an agreement, it may seem like your job is done, but consistent follow-up is crucial at this phase. It's not uncommon for deals to die in the pipeline – even after the prospect has agreed to move forward. 


Regularly check in to address any lingering concerns and keep the prospect engaged. Use follow-up calls, emails, or meetings to reinforce the benefits of your solution and keep the deal moving forward.


###6. Building Relationships and Account Management
After closing the deal, the focus shifts to building a strong, long-term relationship with the client, which starts with a smooth onboarding experience.  


Once your client has signed the dotted line, be sure to guide them through the initial steps of using your product or service and point them to any other people they need to be aware of (i.e., account managers, customer support staff, etc.)


This stage may be more of an account manager or customer success function. Regardless, someone in your company needs to:  


- 
Schedule periodic check-ins to discuss the client's progress, address any issues, and gather feedback.


- 
Identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell additional products or services that can provide further value to the client. 


- 
Quickly resolve issues and be responsive to their questions to strengthen their loyalty and ensure a positive experience. 



Happy clients are more likely to become repeat customers and refer your business to others. Who doesn't want that? 


##Optimize Your B2B Outbound Sales Strategy With AI 
Outbound sales is an important function for almost every thriving B2B organization. It's an effective strategy for reaching prospects, getting quick results, and growing your organization. 


However, it's not a walk in the park. Being good at B2B outbound sales requires you to be skilled at things like overcoming rejection, identifying the right decision-makers, crafting compelling pitches, and more. 


It's a lot to balance. However, AI SDRs can address many of these challenges and streamline the pain points of outbound sales tremendously. 



For example, [Ava, Artisan's AI SDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent), can automate 80% of the sales process. In just 10 minutes, she learns about your ICP and product, creates an outbound campaign, selects leads from her database and starts prospecting. 


She can send personalized sales outreach, write emails, optimize deliverability, and more, totally revolutionizing the outbound sales process of the past. With AI SDRs like Ava, companies can offload the time-consuming parts of sales, so human SDRs can focus more on making connections and closing deals.

#What Is an AI SDR and How Do They Work?
Updated On: July 29, 2024
10 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/ai-sdr)

What if you could bring in thousands of more leads without expanding your SDR team? Well, you can.


AI SDRs are no longer a thing of the future—they're here and taking over the workflows that have slowed our sales teams for decades.


In this guide, we'll introduce you to AI SDRs and show you how to implement them into your workflows to generate more qualified leads.


##Understanding AI SDRs
With only [17% of reps](https://www.techtarget.com/white-paper-ebook/how-does-your-sales-development-program-measure-up/) achieving 90% or higher of quota, AI SDRs are shifting from being a "nice to have" to becoming a major competitive advantage for sales teams.



###What is an AI SDR?
An AI SDR, or AI sales development representative, is software that uses artificial intelligence to perform the tasks typically handled by a human SDR.


The use cases of AI SDRs in sales teams vary. You might entrust them with the entire prospecting process or have them handle specific manual tasks, freeing up your human SDRs to focus on things that matter most. How deeply you integrate AI SDRs in your workflows depends on your comfort with the technology and the sophistication of your tech stack.


Further down the article, we’ll give you all the information you need to choose the best approach for your business.


##AI vs Human SDRs
When thinking about adding AI to your team, it's normal to ask, "How does AI compare to human employees?" 


So, let's break it down and explore the differences and benefits of each.


####AI SDRs
In many instances, AI SDRs outperform human agents:


- 
Scalable processes. Most SDR tasks like cold outreach, follow-ups, and lead scoring are repeatable. With a well-structured process in place, AI can take over these tasks and reach your SDR quota way faster.


- 
Consistent messaging. You don’t have to worry about your messages sounding off. Unlike humans, AI sticks to the script.


- 
Automated optimization. AI SDRs constantly evaluate their performance in the background and make adjustments on the fly. No need to spend hours poring over data.


- 
Lower investment. Scaling SDR with AI doesn’t come with payroll costs or extensive training programs.



Ava is an AI SDR ready to take over your outbound prospecting. [Discover](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) how she can accelerate your sales process.  


####Human SDRs
Yet there are traits only inherent to human SDRs: 


- 
Decision-making in unscripted scenarios. While AI can make decisions based on data input, only human SDRs can manage situations that deviate from the ordinary.


- 
Ability to build personal connection and rapport with customers. Humans can apply their personal traits and emotional intelligence to appeal to leads and create stronger connections with them. 


- 
Understanding of cultural nuances and subtle cues. Human SDRs better handle ongoing conversations for their ability to spot and interpret cultural nuances and contextual cues.



Who comes out on top in the AI SDR vs. human SDR debate? While we'd love to offer a new angle, the answer remains the same: there's no competition between AI and humans to determine winners and losers. AI SDRs will scale your operations and remove the need to hire more SDRs, but you still need a human to move your qualified leads down the funnel.



##4 Reasons to implement AI SDRs
In 2023, less than [5% of B2B sales activities](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-09-21-gartner-expects-sixty-percent-of-seller-work-to-be-executed-by-generative-ai-technologies-within-five-years) were powered by generative AI technologies. By 2028, the number will reach 60%. Such a trend is easily explained by the numerous benefits of AI in sales, particularly in SDR.


###Automate and scale prospecting
Struggling to meet your monthly quota? It's no surprise—your human SDRs spend hours scouring databases, scraping the web for personalization insights, and crafting individualized messages, over and over again. Oh, and don’t forget about follow-ups… 


With AI SDRs, you can automate all these tasks so your human agents can focus solely on mapping out the process. 


Ava has a database of 300M+ B2B prospects that she can instantly search to pinpoint your target customer personas. She also automatically scrapes the web and social media pages to find insights that she uses to personalize the emails she writes. [Try Ava now.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)


###Create a consistent experience for leads
Misspelling names, forgetting follow-ups, or having to change communication points—these can happen even to the best SDRs. Do we even need to discuss how it impacts the lead experience?


AI SDRs let you create a smooth experience for every contact, no matter what. They don’t have vacations or bad days—nothing slips through the cracks in AI-powered processes.


In Artisan, you can create a three-step email sequence that will be sent out every two days so you don’t have to worry about manual follow-ups. If the lead replies, Ava will stop the sequence.



###Enhance your outreach with data-driven actions
AI is great at analyzing data—it can handle large amounts of information and find patterns that humans might miss.


Best of all, AI SDRs can use the data to act fast. For example, they can send a follow-up message when a user repeatedly visits your site or reach out to a prospect after they've posted a career update on LinkedIn.


###Let human SDRs focus on high-priority tasks
AI SDRs are primarily designed to free up your human agents for more critical responsibilities. If your human SDRs have been struggling to prioritize leads and connect with high-ticket prospects, now is the time to address it.

##The Top 5 AI SDRs
Before we dive deeper into the specific applications of AI SDRs in the sales process, let's take a look at the technology that makes it all possible (and prove we aren’t talking science fiction).


###1. Artisan

At Artisan, we’ve developed an [AI SDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) to help businesses automate over 80% of the outbound demand generation process.


What Ava does:


- 
Communicates with your sales team through a chat interface


- 
Understands your ideal customer profile (ICP) based on your product description, target audience, and their pain points


- 
Prospects leads by scraping over 300M contacts in 200 countries across B2B partners’ databases


- 
Enriches leads with third party sources like CrunchBase and web scraping their Twitter, LinkedIn and website


- 
Writes hyper-personalized outreach to leads following different cold email strategies with AI Sales Playbooks 


- 
Uses AI-powered automation to follow up with leads


- 
Manages deliverability with email warmup, dynamic send limits, and many other tools


- 
Integrates with HubSpot, Salesforce, and other systems



With Ava, you have full control over your brand voice without having to micromanage it. You can choose one of the [AI Sales Playbooks](https://www.artisan.co/products/sales-playbooks) to determine how Ava will approach your leads. 



All in all, nothing speaks better than customers’ success stories, right? Medical contract research organization (CRO) [bioaccess](https://www.bioaccessla.com/) entrusted Ava with business development. In just two months, Julio Martinez-Clark, CEO of bioaccess, reports outstanding results:


“I have been using Ava for about two months. I have had a consistent +3% response rate and four sales calls leading to potential sales. Ava simplifies my company’s business development process and fills my calendar with sales calls. This is precisely what I wanted. I wouldn’t trade Ava for anything else in the market!”


Julio Martinez-Clark, CEO of [bioaccess](https://www.bioaccessla.com/)


Ready to hit your SDR quota? [Let Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) automate your outbound workflows and free up your SDRs for more important tasks. 


###2. AiSDR

AiSDR provides AI bots for sales development, focusing on crafting realistic AI emails. 


Similar to Ava, AiSDR scrapes a vast lead database and initiates conversations with leads that match your ICP. The system analyzes leads' latest LinkedIn activity and uses the data to personalize cold pitches.


Users have noted that AiSDR lacks integrations with essential business software such as Salesforce. If integration capabilities are critical for you, consider alternative options from our list.


###3. 11x

On a mission to empower teams with AI workers, 11x has recently introduced Alice, an AI-powered SDR.


Alice identifies potential buyers, researches relevant lead data, and engages them with personalized messages - but you are not able to communicate with Alice. Users have reported issues with bugs on the platform leading to emails being generated in the wrong language.


###4. Relevance.ai

Meet Bosh, the AI SDR from Relevance.ai.


Bosh offers flexibility and integration options. You can deeply integrate it into your workflows, going beyond outbound and prospecting tasks, but the company does not specialize in creating AI SDRs, hence it is less of a focus for them.


Of course, this flexibility comes with a trade-off. Setting up the agent involves extensive training, configuring, and testing the bot.


###Integrating AI SDR with existing sales workflows
“Okay, that sounds good in theory. How do I fit them into my workflows?”


Well, the answer depends on what your existing workflows look like and to what extent you want to automate them with AI SDRs. But regardless of the specifics, your AI SDR integration starts here:


####CRM integration
So you’re managing your sales process through a CRM system. You can integrate your AI SDRs with it to track your interaction with prospects across all channels in one place.



Ava, for instance, integrates seamlessly with HubSpot and Salesforce, allowing sales teams to: 


- 
Prevent outreach to existing customers and prospects


- 
Export all lead data to a centralized system


- 
Build a pipeline with highly qualified leads


- 
Reach out to existing prospects that have gone cold


- 
Build custom sales workflows powered by GenAI 



You can start by using your AI SDR to find and nurture qualified leads, then send them to your CRM system's pipeline for further processing.


####Unified communication channels
Even if you entrust your prospecting process to AI SDRs, you’ll want to stay updated on those conversations. By integrating them into your company’s unified communications, you’ll keep everyone involved updated on the prospecting process and lead updates.


Ava integrates with Slack, so you don’t have to keep logging into Artisan for updates. All notifications will appear in a dedicated channel you can share with specific team members.



####Automated task assignment
Depending on how deeply you integrate AI into your sales workflows, you’ll want to interfere at different stages. 


If you’re just starting out, you may want to approve all of your AI SDR’s actions before it proceeds. As you gain confidence in the system, you might only need to intervene when a user responds to the AI outreach or even later in the process. 


This is where you need to integrate your AI SDRs with your task management software—so you don’t have to manually review every step in the AI workflow and inevitably miss crucial moments for intervention. 


Whether you use ClickUp, Monday, or manage your team’s tasks directly in your CRM system, Ava will soon be able to seamlessly integrate with any platform through Zapier. Simply set trigger events and let automation update your team’s to-do list.


Want to try Ava for yourself? [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/), and she’ll execute successful outbound strategies to boost your conversion rates. Get more meetings booked into your calendar instantly.


##AI SDR in lead generation
Lead generation is typically the most repetitive and automatable task in SDR—perfect for being offloaded to AI. 


Here’s how AI SDRs enhance lead generation:


- 
More accurate lead qualification. In 2023, [41% of sales pros](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/ai-sales-prospecting) were already using AI tools to qualify leads. Considering the rapid adoption of AI, these numbers have likely skyrocketed since then. Clearly, AI SDRs will soon be indispensable to the lead qualification process.


- 
Personalized outreach at scale. When you have 200 pre-qualified leads in your pipeline, spending just two minutes to personalize each message would take almost seven hours of work. AI SDRs can do it faster and without errors. 


- 
24/7 operation. AI SDRs don’t sleep, take breaks, or go on vacation. They can work around the clock, making contact with leads at the best times, regardless of the time zone.


- 
Lead enrichment. Keeping lead profiles updated is hard. AI SDRs like [Artisan’s Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) continuously scrape web and third-party data to update your leads' profiles with relevant information, ensuring you always have reliable data.



##AI SDR in different sales processes
And how do AI SDRs fit into outbound and inbound sales processes? Let’s see. 


###Using AI SDRs for outbound sales 
Outbound SDRs always have their plates full. Not that other members of sales teams aren’t busy, but the outbound sales process involves the most draining repetitive tasks, such as:


- 
Email warmup


- 
Lead discovery and research


- 
Cold email personalization and outreach


- 
Follow-ups



…and so on in a continuous cycle. AI SDRs can take over all of these outbound sales tasks, saving human SDRs’ energy for handling high-intent leads.


Yes, Ava automates the entire outbound sales process. Ready to give it a try? [Talk to our sales team.](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/talk-to-sales)


###Using AI SDRs for inbound sales
AI SDRs are primarily used for automating outbound processes, and understandably so. It's easier to rely on AI when there's minimal risk involved. If they find good leads, great! If not, it's no big deal.



Inbound sales are trickier. We’ve all had our share of impersonal AI chatbot interactions and don’t want to lose those inbound leads to a glitchy AI process. But it's time to leave that mindset in the past.


AI SDRs go far beyond crafting cold emails. They can support inbound sales by:


- 
Automating meeting scheduling


- 
Identifying high-intent buyers with AI-driven sentiment analysis


- 
Transcribing and summarizing discovery calls


- 
Preparing sales meeting agenda


- 
Crafting follow-ups



You can start introducing AI SDRs into inbound sales by letting them take over neglected tasks. Say, if your agents fail to regularly analyze their calls (we know they do), let AI SDRs handle it. Enjoyed the results? Gradually increase their responsibilities.


##Impact on sales teams
[Eighty-two percent](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-trends-report) of sales reps agree that building relationships and connecting are the most important and fulfilling aspects of their job. With AI, they can finally focus on it.



Depending on your current structure and needs, an AI SDR like Ava can assume various responsibilities within your SDR team:


- 
One-person outbound sales team. As a solo startup founder, you can rely on AI SDRs to fill your calendar with sales calls. No need to hire a dedicated team with your limited resources.


- 
Top-of-funnel lead generator. If your A-level SDR team is struggling to meet quotas, bring in AI SDRs to swiftly fill the top of the funnel with qualified leads.


- 
Pocket assistant for human SDRs. AI-powered virtual assistants can free up your SDRs for high-priority tasks by automating manual processes from lead qualification to copywriting.


Ava can replicate your top-performing BDRs and share their strategies across your entire team. Ready to give it a try? [Hire Ava now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).


##Future of AI SDR
Given the rapid pace of AI development, any long-term prediction seems too vague (and futuristic). It will only take months before AI SDRs will become even more sophisticated and widespread.



###Growing trust in AI 
[Seventy-eight percent](https://research.g2.com/2023-buyer-behavior-report) of buyers already trust the accuracy and reliability of AI-powered solutions. This number is only increasing as language learning models and AI solutions continue to improve their accuracy.


With [66% of B2B sales teams](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-sales) having already invested in AI or automation tools, AI SDRs will soon become an inseparable part of successful sales teams.


###More capabilities to come
Technological development has accelerated to a point where you don’t have to wait for the next major update for years.


For now, most AI SDRs successfully handle outbound activities like lead qualification and cold outreach. In a few months, our developers will release many more capabilities, including call monitoring, direct meeting scheduling capabilities, sales agenda outlining, and more. 


Ava and other AI SDRs are on track to offer end-to-end sales development solutions, consolidating fragmented product stacks under one roof.


Get started with an AI SDR now. [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/), and she’ll launch a lead generation campaign for you immediately.

#Breaking Down the 8 Essential Stages of the B2B Sales Pipeline
Created On: July 29, 2024

[According to Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/sales-enablement-report?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-pipeline&hubs_post-cta=40%25%20of%20businesses&_ga=2.254902477.45855186.1721953845-849358351.1719888644&_gl=1*e113dv*_gcl_au*MTA4Njg5NTM4NC4xNzE5ODg4NjQ0*_ga*ODQ5MzU4MzUxLjE3MTk4ODg2NDQ.*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcyMjAyNDQ4NS4xMC4xLjE3MjIwMjQ3MDkuNTIuMC4w), 40% of businesses fail to hit revenue goals. Is this because of bad products or markets in a downturn? 


No. It’s because they haven’t implemented a well-managed B2B sales pipeline. 


But what exactly is the sales pipeline? Is it the same as a sales funnel? What are the steps of a functional pipeline that gives us real insight into an overall sales process?


In this article, we’ll cover the eight essential phases of a significant sales pipeline and provide insights into what goes into a robust sales strategy that you can deploy and optimize. 


##What is a B2B Sales Pipeline?
The B2B sales pipeline is the map of all touchpoints potential leads move through, from first touch to final sale. As the name suggests, these touchpoints are arranged sequentially, a pathway for your sales team to engage future customers.



More importantly, the pipeline gives your team the visibility and structure to understand the relationships between different stages, what it means to nurture customers through various stages, and how to optimize each part of the pipeline to increase leads and sales. 


##Benefits of a Structured Sales Pipeline
The point of a sales pipeline is to ensure that leads follow a well-structured path where your organization can engage them every step of the way. 


Some of the core benefits of a well-structured B2B sales pipeline include the following:


###1. Improved sales forecasting accuracy
Since your pipeline will contain well-defined and demarcated engagement and lead evaluation stages, it is much easier to understand how far each lead has gone down the pipeline and forecast potential sales. And, with increased forecasting accuracy comes increased revenue. 


###2. Enhanced lead management and nurturing
With optimized sales pipeline management, sales can more effectively nurture potential buyers toward a purchase using behavioral data, targeted messaging, and advanced lead nurturing techniques that draw from accurate lead qualifications and multi-channel communications. 


###3. Increased visibility into the sales process
A sales pipeline gives you a bird's-eye view of your prospecting and nurturing landscape, with the option of zooming in to view any specific contact point. This means a clearer vision of the customer journey, particular processes for nurturing leads, and places where poor sales tactics or performance bottlenecks limit productivity.


###4. Better alignment between sales and marketing efforts
Sales and marketing departments often work on different schedules and priorities. That being said, marketing is critical to help raise brand awareness and nurture leads through the sales process with enablement materials and other types of content. With a well-structured pipeline, you can make sure your marketing materials are tailored for specific leads at specific points of their customer journey.


##B2B Sales Pipeline vs. B2B Sales Funnel
If you are around marketing and sales professionals, you might hear phrases like “funnel” and “pipeline” used interchangeably (and incorrectly). These frameworks represent fundamentally different ideas for shaping the customer journey through various sales activities.



###Focus and Scope
- 
A sales pipeline describes how a lead moves through an ongoing sales process, from lead generation to conversion and maintenance. You might consider this your perspective on generating leads, demonstrating a product’s features, and optimizing customer engagement via strategic outreach. When mapping a B2B pipeline, you’ll most likely focus on metrics like sales performance, lead generation, and how leads are nurtured from one process point to another. 


- 
A sales funnel represents the customer’s approach to your product or service, starting with broad awareness (the “mouth” or the “top of the funnel”) and moving through consideration, evaluation, and sale (the “bottom of the funnel”). The scope of the funnel includes metrics on initial contact, conversion rates at different parts of the funnel, and where (potentially) paying customers enter the funnel. 


###Stages and Progression
- 
The sales pipeline involves more sequential processes involving direct action from your salespeople or automation technologies. These stages start with sales prospecting and move through lead qualification, needs assessment, and so on, to a final sale and ongoing support. At each point of this pipeline, the emphasis is on action. Sales representatives understand how the actions and data collected inform their performance in the next task.


- 
On the other hand, the sales funnel details the customer journey and what they might look for during that journey. The broader strategies deployed at the top of the funnel (awareness) represent potential customers just learning about your brand, and outreach throughout that buying process moves with the customer towards consideration, evaluation, and intent to purchase. This approach is much more generalized than the pipeline approach. 



While the funnel gives a big-picture understanding of a customer journey, the pipeline reflects specific stages and optimized actions during those stages.


##8 Essential B2B Sales Pipeline Stages

###Stage 1: Prospecting Potential Customers
The sales cycle starts with potential customers. You must have an ideal picture of your customer and an understanding of how to reach that target audience. 


The first step in sales pipeline management is to generate ICPs that reflect the customers you want to approach. Creating a good ICP will involve identifying your top B2B companies based on demographics, financial characteristics, and behavioral characteristics – information that you should be able to utilize through an advanced platform like Artisan and our database of 300M+ B2B contacts. 


The next step involves prospecting potential inbound customers that align with your ideal customer profile. Outreach can include cold calling and cold emailing, networking at industry events, or (more common in modern sales) leveraging social media platforms like LinkedIn to target potential leads with paid and organic messaging.


###Stage 2: Lead Qualification
Lead qualification determines a new lead's value against your business or product strategies. Sales experts can apply any of the criteria or methodologies to apply a score to potential candidates to separate the “wheat from the chaff” or, more accurately, poor leads from those with the potential to become sales. 


To qualify leads, you should focus on scoring criteria based on a methodology. What is important to you–demographics? Revenue? Behaviors?


Leads can be scored across criteria like:


- 
Demographics include professional positions, industry, location, and income. 


- 
Behavioral qualities like responses to email sequences or browsing patterns on e-commerce sites. 


- 
Predictive lead scoring, usually supported by machine learning or AI, can use historical and CRM data to predict a lead's potential. 


- 
Negative scoring takes points away from leads with specific criteria. 



Typically, approaching scoring through a single criterion will have the least amount of flexibility or accuracy to qualify leads. A more comprehensive framework allows you to rank leads across several criteria. 


One such framework is the Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline ([BANT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/BANT)) framework, which combines a few data points to qualify a lead: who they are, whether they can make decisions, and whether they can afford the solution.



Another approach you can deploy is [MEDDIC](https://meddicc.com/meddic-sales-qualification-and-frameworks) (Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identifying pain, and Champion). MEDDIC is a more in-depth alternative to BANT, asking you to understand pain points and customer decision-making processes. 


BANT and MEDDIC criteria can be formulated during the initial prospecting stage through conversations, surveys, or interviews. This involves specialized and targeted questions that can gather this information:


- 
Phone calls can be an immediate and “human” approach to information-gathering, but they require a time investment from the prospect.


- 
Emails are much more convenient but often ignored; even the best piece of email marketing can be lost or forgotten in a bust inbox.


- 
Surveys are great ways to gather specific information but can feel informal or a chore for a prospect. 



Use Artisan’s database of 300M+ B2B contacts to build an elite lead-scoring framework. [Try Ava Now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).


###Stage 3: Needs Assessment
Making a sale is impossible without clearly understanding the new customer’s needs. Fortunately, there’s a great way to find that information during initial and ongoing meetings. 


Once you’ve identified, prospected, and qualified a lead, it’s critical to identify their pain points and explain how your solution solves them. 


Some more effective ways to get leads to open up about pain points include:


- 
Using open-ended questions to provoke thoughtful responses. 


- 
Using follow-up questions to dig into details of specific challenges.


- 
Develop hypothetical scenarios where the customer has to talk about a particular approach or ideal for their organization. 


- 
Ask about personal insights alongside quantifiable faces (i.e., “Why do you think X is a problem?”)


You could also offer a free demo at this juncture. [Hubspot notes](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-pipeline) that prospects are 75% likely to buy at the demo stage. 


###Stage 4: Proposal Creation
So, you’ve identified a lead, qualified it, and you have a pretty good grasp of their needs and pain points. If you’re in this far, a buyer will expect a proposal outlining what purchasing might look like. This isn’t just an invoice or a marketing brochure; it’s an in-depth description of what the customer will get and how this customer relationship will unfold. 


A typical proposal will include some primary sections like:


- 
An introduction and needs statement that outlines the terms of the relationship and the features and capabilities you are delivering to solve specific problems.


- 
A description of the specific solutions, features, functions, or tools sold or provided to the customer.


- 
Deliverables like access to the product, any white-glove or support services, credits, and so on.


- 
A timeline for these deliverables, including immediate next steps.
 


- 
Pricing, payment terms, and deadlines.


- 
Case studies and testimonials that demonstrate the value of your solution to decision-makers. 


###Stage 5: Negotiation with Decision-Makers
If you have nurtured a prospect this far, congratulations – [leads at the negotiation stage are 90% likely to buy](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-pipeline). The initial proposal isn’t a final agreement, however. Once it is in the customer's hands, negotiations will likely follow to hammer out specifics and reach a mutually beneficial arrangement. 


Some of the more critical parts of negotiating with decision-makers include:


- 
Identifying customer wants and needs and balancing them against your expectations, sales targets, and business goals.


- 
Fielding objections and counter-proposals with understanding and flexibility without sacrificing profitability or growth. This will include a strong knowledge of the product and its capabilities.


- 
Recognizing where negotiations have stalled and how to keep things moving forward, even if that includes escalation or including other stakeholders. 



###Stage 6: Closing Deals
All these negotiations lead toward the ultimate goal of closing the deal. However, getting a potential customer to make a final purchasing decision can be just as difficult as the negotiations proceeding with that decision. 


How can you close a deal effectively? You can:


- 
Act like the deal is closed (assumptive close), ushering the customer toward the adoption and onboarding phase.


- 
Create urgency (urgency close) through limited-time deals or a window for accepting a proposal.


- 
Summarizing (summary close) all the benefits the customer will experience is a way to highlight your product's positive aspects and keep the process moving.


- 
Maintain a direct approach (direct close) and frankly approach the customer with a sense of transparency.



None of these approaches is one-size-fits-all, and you still need to apply common sense and intuition to understand if a lead is ready to buy. 


Some signs that they want to move to the next stage include 


- 
Forward questions about implementation or budget


- 
Discussions about specifics about the final terms of the proposal


- 
Providing positive feedback on the proposal or product


- 
Seeking a trial or demo of your product and services


###Stage 7: Implementation and Onboarding
The transition from sales to implementation is a crucial phase that ensures a smooth handover from the sales team to the implementation or customer success team. This phase is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring that the promises made during the sales process are effectively delivered. 


A handover phase will include initial kick-off meetings, planning, and expectation-setting. At this point, you’ll most likely cover the finer points of implementation, risk management, and security. 


Next is onboarding and training. Sometimes, onboarding can be automated via online platforms and knowledge repositories. For more advanced training needs, support resources (like customer service and documentation) will complement a more robust engagement with virtual or on-site training programs. 


Finally, there’s monitoring to ensure customer success. This is perhaps the most important part of implementation. You must have the workforce and support that the customer expects in place so that they remain a customer and meet the outcomes you identified during the sales process. 


###Stage 8: Follow-Up and Support
The deal is done, and the customer is on board and using the solution. But your work isn’t over. It’s imperative to support that customer so that they get the best service possible. This leads to better feedback, better testimonials and stories, continued revenue, and the potential for future sales through referrals. 


Support is a proactive process. Treating customers as important as any other customer is also critical. This includes 


- 
Having a dedicated point of contact for the customer who is regularly available and responsive.


- 
Conducting proactive outreach via regular check-ins.


- 
Automating regular surveys triggered on specific events that allow customers to provide feedback.


- 
Using CRM systems like Artisan that track ongoing interactions and keep records of customer preferences and needs.


- 
Create feedback loops by constantly collecting, analyzing, and acting on customer data using your sales team, customer service team, and CRM.



These sales opportunities can be used to cross-sell or up-sell products or services that address existing or emerging customer needs.

[A Hubspot report ](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-trends-report?hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-statistics&hubs_signup-cta=HubSpot&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-statistics&hubs_post-cta=HubSpot&_ga=2.51143532.45855186.1721953845-849358351.1719888644&_gl=1*1jbt6zv*_gcl_au*MTA4Njg5NTM4NC4xNzE5ODg4NjQ0*_ga*ODQ5MzU4MzUxLjE3MTk4ODg2NDQ.*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcyMjAyMTg0Ny45LjAuMTcyMjAyMTg0Ny42MC4wLjA.)shows that 32% of salespeople see the volume of emails sent as a sign of productivity. It follows that automation is a significant part of sales management, and AI is radically transforming automation to help salespeople optimize their pipeline. 


AI SDRs (like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)) are the perfect tool for blending creativity with sales automation. For example, our AI SDR can handle personalized email sequences to nurture leads through different sales pipeline phases.

#How AI Is Changing Outbound Sales Automation in 2024
Updated On: July 12, 2024
11 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/outbound-sales-automation)

Let’s be clear. If you’re doing outbound sales and still heavily relying on repetitive manual tasks, you’re doing something wrong. If you and your sales team are spending hours researching and writing individual emails to prospects, the ugly truth is that you’re quickly going to fall behind your competitors. It’s not that you’re doing anything wrong per se – it’s just that the numbers simply can’t compare.


[According to Operatix](https://www.operatix.net/blogs/sdr-metrics-outbound-inbound-teams/), an outbound SDR books an average of fifteen meetings a month, of which only twelve will actually be completed. That might not seem too bad on its own, but when you consider that most outbound engines consist of tens of SDRs, all being paid handsomely for performing repetitive tasks by hand, it starts to sound majorly suspect.




From Operatix's SDR Metrics Report


So it should probably come as no surprise that implementing outbound sales automation tools produces compelling results indeed. [Hubspot’s research](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-automation-stats) shows companies that invest in AI and automation software report a 10-20% boost in sales ROI; of the top sellers, 80% use these tools on a regular basis. 


These companies aren’t just saving time (though [49% of them](https://www.kixie.com/sales-blog/27-sales-automation-statistics-you-need-to-know-in-2023/) say that’s the single biggest benefit). They’re also improving communication and allocating more of their most precious resource – the energy of their employees – towards higher-quality, more challenging tasks. 


Outbound sales automation isn’t going anywhere, clearly. So it’s probably best if you understand it as deeply as possible. Let’s take a closer look.


##Key Components of Outbound Sales Automation

###Lead Generation and Scoring
Widely considered every rep’s least favorite job, lead generation and qualification is the bedrock of every successful pipeline. But it’s repetitive, it’s boring, and it’s dangerously prone to human error – just try sending an email to a mistyped address and see how far it gets you.


All of these factors make it the ideal task to be automated. By setting out predefined criteria, outbound sales automation programs can gather, organize, and score leads at a scale that humans simply can’t compete with. 


###Drafting and Sending Personalized Email Sequences and Follow-Up Messages
Before too long, we’re going to have to retire the phrase “the human touch”, because recent advances in AI have made those lines a whole lot blurrier than they used to be. Using a range of high-tech features, automated sales software is more than capable of developing personalized cold emails and follow-up communications based on customer behavior and preferences. Social media post scraping, for example, makes it possible to get instant insight into a prospect’s mindset and gather intent data at scale, while technographic data can be gathered to see what tech stack they’re currently using. 


And thanks to the increasingly multi-modal nature of these programs, it’s possible to automate the task of following up across several different channels. It’s not just email: social media platforms, text messages and even phone calls can all join the party, saving even more time for sales reps and radically increasing workflow efficiency.


###Automate Repetitive Administrative Tasks
Data entry. Meeting scheduling. Updating CRM records. To know them is to loathe them, but these dull admin jobs are an essential element in any successful sales engine. Thankfully, we might not need to dread doing them ourselves for much longer.


Due to its repetitive nature, this kind of busywork is a prime candidate for automation. There’s little to no independent reasoning required. In most cases, it’s a tick-box exercise where the only criterion for success is not getting anything wrong. And even the best sales professionals make mistakes, especially when they’ve been doing the same task for hours – but machines don’t.


##Optimizing the Sales Process

###Workflow Automation
When it comes to optimizing a sales process, there’s no better place to start than at the workflow level. There are a number of different ways automation can be employed, but the most common include automating repetitive tasks (like the ones mentioned above) and designing more efficient, AI-friendly workflows from the ground up. 


For example, if a company knows it’s going to be using outbound sales automation software, there’s no reason to train its reps on tasks like data entry or CRM updates. Instead, the workflow could be crafted to work with the AI – effectively using the result of its busywork, double-checking for errors, tweaking personalized cold emails, and so on.


Are you ready to try sales automation on the cutting edge? [Check out how Ava can automate 80% of your outbound cycle.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) She frees up your sales team’s time to focus on the most important thing – closing deals!


###Lead Generation and Management
Outbound sales automation software can – and will – revolutionize the way you think about lead generation and lead management. Forget about painstakingly scouring LinkedIn, Google, and other sources to compile a list of prospects. Just set the program up with your ideal customer profile (ICP) and let it do the heavy lifting for you.


But the magic doesn’t stop there. High-end automation software will also pre-qualify the prospects on your lead lists by bounce-testing leads, assessing them against your ideal ICP, and ranking them by priority. As a result, by the time your reps start interacting with them, they already know where to focus most of their time and energy. And with automated enrichment, by the time salespeople interact with the potential customers in their sales pipeline, they’ll already have a wealth of data to draw on.


###Email Campaigns and Sequences
Here’s a statistic so ridiculous that it sounds made-up at first. [According to research](https://www.rpeorigin.com/2023/09/2023-new-research-on-enterprise-use-of-ai-in-email/) carried out by Ascend2 RPE Origina, running A/B tests on your emails can increase ROI by 82%, from 23:1 all the way to 42:1. A/B testing is just one of several weapons in any outbound sales team’s arsenal – and sales automation software is capable of performing those analyses all on its own.


A/B testing isn’t the only way email automation can enhance marketing efforts, though. It can set up, run, and optimize entire outreach campaigns. By drawing on a wealth of customer preference data, sales automation programs can personalize every aspect of the email outreach process. Automated email playbooks can be generated based on what content those customers are most likely to respond to, for example, while real-time email sequences make it possible to interact with each ideal customer at the perfect moment based on past behavior.


##Enhancing Sales Team Productivity

###Roles of Sales Reps and SDRs
So far, we’ve focused on the technical nitty-gritty behind what automation software is actually doing. But we haven’t discussed the elephant in the room yet. What happens to the reps and SDRs who all of a sudden find they’ve got nothing left to do because it’s all been automated?


Well, that’s not quite the case. Sure, sales team members won’t be as busy with time-consuming, manual tasks like lead scoring or churning out follow-up emails. Instead, they’ll be devoting their energy towards high-value sales engagement activities that only they can perform.


The actual art of selling – the cold calling, the back-and-forth, the push-and-pull, the cat and the proverbial mouse – is all still firmly the domain of humans. And because they don’t need to waste time on manual busywork, reps and SDRs will be able to hyper-focus their sales efforts on the tasks that ultimately bring in revenue for their organization. 


There’s still a place for traditional sales reps, sales managers, and SDRs. But their role is going to look drastically different from how it used to – more productive, more challenging, and ultimately more rewarding.

And for companies, the potential for improvement is just as significant. Every manager has wished they could make a dozen copies of their best-performing rep and populate the entire team with them. Well, that’s pretty much possible now, with the ability to replicate the strategies of top-performing salespeople, streamline them, and circulate them across the entire team. By making the most of an automation platform, every BDR can be turned into a top-performing sales rep, radically increasing productivity and efficiency across the board.


###Sales Engagement Strategies
According to a [2023 study](https://belkins.io/blog/cold-email-response-rates#:~:text=The%20average%20cold%20email%20response,from%206.1%25%20to%202.5%25.) carried out by Belkins, cold email reply rates range from as low as 2% in some major industries to as high as 10% in others. Which is less than ideal, given that the ROI for emails can be as [high as 45x](https://www.litmus.com/blog/infographic-the-roi-of-email-marketing). So increasing response rates should obviously be a matter of high priority for any team looking to optimize its sales funnel, schedule more meetings and fill up its pipeline with high-quality potential deals.



From Litmus' ROI of Email Marketing Infographic


Fortunately, automation can help out here as well. Machine-learning powered outbound sales technology makes personalized outreach possible at a scale humans simply can’t compete with, allowing forward-thinking sales teams to ramp up their volume without needing to sacrifice the individual touch that can often make all the difference.


In a similar vein, consistency, frequency and optimal timing are all elements of the outreach process that can be automated with ease. The potential for ultra-precise segmentation gives every single email the best chance of reaching its ideal customer, while detailed analytics and comprehensive A/B testing functionality makes it possible to improve the overall process in real-time.


##Leveraging Technology for Sales Success

###AI-Powered Automation
We’ve already discussed how that outbound sales automation technology is capable of personalizing sales outreach communication at scale. But we haven’t actually discussed what that looks like in practice – and what better real-world example than Artisan’s very own [AI BDR, Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)?


Ava’s capable of scraping prospects’ social media posts in order to update her customer profiles with the most recent personal data. For instance, imagine you’re a B2B SaaS company selling HR payroll software. Your ideal customers, in this example, are startups that have just raised funding. Ava, thanks to her Crunchbase integration, will automatically be able to identify startups that have recently raised rounds, enroll them in a workflow, and be the first one in their email inbox with a hyper-personalized message.


Now picture that same process happening constantly, across every single prospect you’re working with, without your reps needing to lift a finger. If that’s not a game-changer, we don’t know what is.


The real beauty of AI-powered automation lies in its ability to continuously learn and improve. Predictive analytics, powered by the constant stream of data the software is taking in, makes it possible to discover trends, make informed predictions about future performance and tweak your current strategy for the highest probability of success. And because it’s all powered by AI, the entire process can happen at as large a scale as you need it to.


###Integrations and Functionalities
The modern business world is hyper-connected, so it only stands to reason that sales software should be as well. And as any SDR will be able to tell you, the sheer amount of business tools available these days is nothing short of staggering. Email marketing software, CRMs, data integration suites, analytics programs – the list goes on.


With such a smorgasbord of tools being used on a daily basis, it’s vitally important that outbound sales automation software can integrate with all of them. Switching seamlessly from prospecting software to updating your CRM of choice, drawing on analytics reports to inform cold email outreach: it all works together, and it all just works.


But none of that means you should need to completely redesign your existing strategies in order to implement automation technology. The best software will automatically hook into your existing CRM, automatically trawling through your existing insights and re-engaging qualified leads that have gone cold. Next, it’ll update your CRM with ultra-precise, bang up-to-date details like method of engagement, behavior data points, additional insights, and so on.

All of this helps optimize your process and increase your results, and it all happens on auto-pilot, freeing up dozens of hours of manual work that can be redirected towards actively selling instead.

##Measuring and Improving Sales Performance

###Key Metrics and KPIs
One of the biggest advantages provided by sales automation tools is their ability to process huge amounts of data.


- 
Conversion Rates. By analyzing conversion rates at scale across your entire funnel, automation can help identify speed bumps and suggest strategies for fixing the problem, saving you dozens of hours of manual analysis in the process.


- 
Sales Cycle Time. Automation can spot the points in the sales cycle that accelerate it the most and help you prioritize them in your process. 


- 
Lead-to-Close Ratios. When you use automation to analyze your lead-to-close ratios, you get far deeper insights into areas for optimization thanks to the sheer depth and breadth of the data being mined.


###Continuous Optimization
Not unlike those sharks who never stop moving, if a sales team stops optimizing its process, it’ll fall behind its competitors. Thankfully, outbound sales automation software allows you to improve as you go across the board.

With automation, software will be able to automatically set different campaigns, run tests, and implement improvements based on KPIs and ideal results. We’re essentially entering a new paradigm of continuous and automatic optimization, where sales reps don’t have to manually set and adjust campaigns anymore, and where every major decision throughout the outbound sales process is made based on huge treasure troves of cold, hard data.


##A Look Ahead to Emerging Tools and Technologies

###AI and Machine Learning
AI and Machine Learning is poised to radically disrupt the current sales landscape – the advantages offered by automation are just too much of a game-changer to ignore. For example, take [Ava, Artisan’s AI BDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent). She’ll be able to automate 80% of a human BDR’s workflow, make her own autonomous decisions, brief you on upcoming meetings, reach out to new prospects, and keep everything meticulously updated in her CRM. By using cutting-edge technology to analyze, implement, and continuously optimize at scale, forward-looking organizations will find themselves at a distinct advantage over any of their competitors who haven’t yet integrated automation into their processes.


###Enhanced CRM Capabilities
As AI continues to improve day-by-day, CRMs are becoming more powerful than ever. Some of the most exciting features include natural language processing, sentiment analysis, real-time decision-making, and even truly sci-fi concepts like recognizing faces or voices via biometric analysis. For a sales rep using the CRM of tomorrow, the workflow is going to be almost unrecognizable. Instead of manually entering lead data and moving the process along by hand, they might simply talk to their software instead, asking for specific insights, the latest updates on their deals, or guidance as to what they should focus on next.

The CRM will be able to suggest the best way for the rep to spend their time based on the current state of the pipeline. Maybe it’s the perfect moment to reach out to that prospect from a couple weeks ago, because sentiment analysis of a recent Tweet has revealed they’re particularly unhappy with their current solution. Or maybe it’s time to strike while the iron is hot on a few new leads, because past insights on leads in a similar industry indicates they respond best to a quick invitation to a product demo. 


The possibilities are endless; the potential, staggering. To sum it all up in plain English, it’s an exciting time to be in sales – and the future’s only getting brighter.


Experience cutting-edge sales automation firsthand. [Hire Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) and she’ll immediately launch a lead generation campaign just for you, focusing all her efforts on high-quality leads and quick results.

Customer Story

##bioaccess
Transforming Business Development with Ava –
Julio Martinez-Clark, CEO of bioaccess™

“The platform is just fantastic. It has made our business development outreach way easier, automated, and systematic.”

bioaccess™ is a niche contract research organization (CRO) that facilitates medical device trials. Operating in the hubs of medical innovation in the US, bioaccess™ assists in regulatory approvals, patient recruitment, and the coordination of trials between sponsors and hospitals.

##Before Artisan, bioaccess Was Struggling With Lead Generation - Now They Achieve a Consistent 1.2% Positive Response Rate
Before having Artisan Sales as a part of their tech stack and hiring Ava, bioaccess relied heavily on word-of-mouth and manual lead generation, which were time-consuming and inconsistent. Their outreach efforts were mostly reactive, waiting for potential clients to contact them. As a small company, bioaccess™ found it challenging to scale their business development efforts without additional resources.


”We are looking to get acquired in 3 to 5 years, and for that to happen, we need to show our potential buyer that we are a money making machine and that we have a systematic way of finding leads. Artisan has given us that. That possibility. So it's really a godsend.”


##Artisan Gave bioaccess an Easy & Automated Way to Generate Hot Leads on Autopilot
Artisan's platform, powered by Ava, revolutionized bioaccess’ approach to business development. Ava integrated data from various sources, including a niche provider, to create a comprehensive and up-to-date database of potential clients.


”We're a small company - we only had a few people before using Artisan and were wasting a lot of time doing a small volume of manual lead generation. Now I have Ava doing 24/7 mass outreach for us, which is fantastic.”


When asked what Julio would want to change about Artisan, he said “nothing.” He did say that he was very excited about our product roadmap, and that he looks forward to the new features Artisan plans to roll out for sales and the Marketing Artisan. 


Bioaccess didn’t have the resources to hire a full-time BDR to do their outreach. With Ava, at a fraction of the cost of a human BDR, they’re getting the same volume of leads.

#How To Use AI For Sales Prospecting [+5 Best Tools For 2024]
Updated On: July 23, 2024
10 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/ai-for-sales-prospecting)

##Introduction
If you’re like most sales reps, you’re coming up against the massive push to integrate AI into all our workflows. And for good reason. AI is a sea of change for automating and optimizing our sales prospecting efforts. 


But how does AI impact sales prospecting in clear and practical ways? It's all about creative and tech-savvy people leveraging solutions to make their jobs that much easier.


Here, we’re covering the how, the who, and the where of AI in sales prospecting, including our five favorite platforms in 2024. 


##Understanding AI in Sales Prospecting
Sales prospecting is the bread and butter of most sales functions. But modern sales software has a way of radically shifting how we think of traditional practices. 


###What is sales prospecting, and how is it important?
Sales prospecting identifies and engages customers (prospects) who could find value in your brand or products. At the heart of this process is the sales pipeline through which you can nurture leads from first contact to final sale. 


The steps in this pipeline include:


- 
Identifying possible leads based on your ideal customer profile and research.


- 
Qualifying these leads to determine if they fit your profiles.


- 
Engaging leads through ongoing marketing efforts, such as emails, social media outreach, or other approaches. This step could include cool or informative assets like demos, direct meetings, or easily accessible marketing materials.


- 
Nurturing leads through the pipeline by building relationships through strategic engagement at touch points.


- 
Converting those leads into sales.



The idea of a sales pipeline is essential because it gives you a representation of your sales flow–a critical blueprint to guide strategy, optimization, and forecasting. This helps you create and optimize marketing strategies that speak to those customers. 


###How is AI enhancing sales prospecting?
[According to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), two primary areas where AI has been implemented are product development and marketing/sales. In the latter's case, adoption has more than doubled in the past year. 



This is where AI revolutionizes prospecting–drawing from the automated and data-driven capabilities of AI to boost core prospecting efforts. Modern salespeople are looking to AI to enhance processes like:


- 
Qualifying leads quickly and accurately. AI eliminates manual labor in qualifying leads, saving time and improving consistency. Automating the process means that qualification standards are applied consistently across potential candidates, and the best leads rise to the top.


- 
Streamlining outreach without sacrificing quality. AI can take outreach one step further by applying intelligence to engage customers based on complex behaviors.


- 
Delivering real personalization shaped with data. Marketers are quickly learning how AI can help them personalize sales outreach with tailored messaging and human-like chatbots.


- 
Using data to drive decisions. As salespeople, we love our data, but we can’t truly digest all of it on our own. That’s why [73% of professionals](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/state-of-ai-sales#:~:text=Yet%2C%20when%20we%20look%20at,what%20they%20do%20best:%20selling.) see AI helping them pull more insights from their data than they could alone. AI does this while providing a ready source of actionable suggestions based on customer behavioral insights.



These enhancements have real-world impacts. [According to a Deloitte report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/yes-you-can-take-the-guesswork-out-of-lead-gen.html), a cloud services company adopting AI into its sales prospect pipeline experienced a 20% increase in pipeline volume. 


###What are the benefits of AI in sales prospecting?
With AI, sales teams can improve their processes internally (regarding logistics and productivity) and externally (outreach and messaging).



With AI, you can:


- 
Cut costs in terms of time, money, and resources. 


- 
Boost productivity so salespeople can do more with the same resources.


- 
Draw from actual data to brainstorm creative assets like emails, social media posts, and engagement campaigns.


- 
Tailor messaging to discrete audiences effectively.


- 
Improve your ability to map email sequences for outreach and follow-up.

###The essential AI technologies driving sales prospecting
Marketing and sales platforms that leverage AI are most likely incorporating one or more of these intelligent automation technologies to revamp or streamline one or more processes completely: 


- 
If AI is intelligence, machine learning is the learning foundation on which it is built. These algorithms rely on historical data and models (language or analytical models) to provide deep insights into particular trends or data sets.


- 
One area where machine learning contributes is predictive analytics, or the use of intelligent algorithms to predict future trends in data. For example, an AI providing predictive analytics can offer hypothetical scores to leads based on existing data to inform where and how marketing pros identify leads. 


- 
Gen AI represents a massive step forward in intelligent systems, and professionals are noticing… [which is why 65% of respondents to a McKinsey survey noted their use of the technology](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai). Gen AI is perfect for language learning and communication, content generation, and supporting conversational customer interactions.


- 
Modern chatbots can have fully realized conversations with potential customers and react in real time, providing information or insight that guides the customer from an initial contact towards a more meaningful engagement.


- 
Modern sales and marketing rely on immediacy. Real-time insights combine AI's speed and creativity to deliver a better customer experience to the prospect. 


##How to Implement AI in Sales Prospecting
The notion of “implementing AI” into a process like prospecting might seem daunting for non-specialists. And yet, [68% of sales professionals](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/state-of-ai-sales) predict that most software will already have AI baked in–signaling that maybe sales professionals don’t have to worry too much about accessing the technology because it is already here.  


That leaves you with the need to plan, adopt, and optimize your use of AI. 


###Steps to integrate AI tools into your sales process
While AI is an exciting tool, it is, after all, just a tool. You must know your ideal customer profile and how AI can help you prospect them. 



Then, it’s all about finding the right tool for the right job. So, do you need:


- 
Specific or Comprehensive Tools? Is it a niche feature that will bring those prospects in, or something more end-to-end (like [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/)) where AI is baked into the entire prospecting pipeline? 


- 
Broad or Focused Capabilities? If you’re looking for automated email outreach, you might not need an entire suite of automated tools better served for an omni-channel approach. For example, while Artisan provides AI support across the outbound cycle, another platform like Reply.io focuses on automating outreach. 


- 
Extensive Integrations? If you’re firmly rooted in a productivity or CRM environment, then it’s imperative for any solution to fit within your workflow. Most businesses fit within this model, but having an entire library of integrations might not be that important for others. 


- 
Expert Support and Usability? How familiar is your team with AI tools? If you want to adapt quickly, you will look for extensive usability, training, and educational resources.


##Best Practices for Using AI in Sales
AI works primarily as a tool, but real expertise is required to make the most of it. That’s where marketers' skills and knowledge can apply best practices and create something truly engaging for their prospects. 


###Focus on personalization
Writing personalized emails takes time and energy that could be better spent on strategies or direct engagements with prospects. AI can streamline the process by building emails from pre-existing templates or approaches. 



Artisan’s email writing features include proprietary playbooks that address personal connections like shared university backgrounds or offer thought-provoking and relevant industry questions that prompt conversations with prospects. 


Leverage proprietary AI-crafted emails to make your prospecting content powerful and personal in a way that gets responses. [Try Ava Now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).


###Make sure to follow up
When, where, and how to follow up with prospects requires data entry, planning, and scheduling hours. But, with AI tools (especially all-in-one solutions), you can automate outreach and follow-ups based on contexts, time-based criteria, or prospect behavior. In Artisan, you can automate three-step email sequences that will stop once that prospect responds. 


Automated outreach allows you to focus on being thoughtful and creative rather than managing spreadsheets and calendars–a reality that, [according to Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-statistics/#h-marketers-believe-generative-ai-will-transform-their-role-but-worry-about-accuracy), seven out of ten markets expect to become a reality. 


###Optimize, optimize, optimize
Above and beyond all, you should use AI to optimize all outbound materials to capitalize on what works and weed out approaches that down. From calls to emails and social media engagement, AI can help you deliver better information and value to prospects based on real insights. 


###Always rely on data
Personalization, follow-up, optimization… These best practices work because you can use data to tailor each to real insights rather than gut feelings or trends. With Artisan’s database of 300M+ B2B contacts, you’re never relying on anything but the best data to inform your decision-making.

##Challenges and Considerations
Like any other technology, AI sales prospecting tools come with their own set of challenges:


- 
Integrations. Solutions focusing on integration will typically include the most well-used platforms. For example, Artisan integrates with HubSpot and Salesforce and provides engineering services to support other integrations that our customers need. 


- 
Training and Culture. [39% of marketers don’t know how to use GenAI safely, and 43% claim they don’t know how to get the most value from it](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-statistics/#h-marketers-believe-generative-ai-will-transform-their-role-but-worry-about-accuracy). That’s why support and educational services (like those offered by Artisan) are critical to ensuring a smooth transition and adoption phase.


- 
Privacy. Whether you work in healthcare, financial services, or government-adjacent business, your solution must meet industry-specific standards and policies related to security and privacy (such as perimeter security, data obfuscation, or access controls). 


##Future Trends in AI Sales Prospecting
Sales prospecting is rapidly evolving, and in many ways, it’s impossible to tell where the technology will go. However, there are two directions in which we see innovation taking off:


- 
AI Automation. Sophisticated AI systems will open up automation in an increasing pool of tasks and processes, including more sophisticated insights, integrations, and customer experiences. At some point, it’s unlikely that humans will handle manual tasks related to their pipeline again. 


- 
AI Employees. Artisan sees the future of AI prospecting as including AI-powered Sales and Business Development Representatives who can work side-by-side with human professionals to make outreach even quicker and more effective.

##20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30)days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

Binding Arbitration

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the [American Arbitration Association (AAA) website](http://www.adr.org/). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1)years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Restrictions

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

#The 4 Best SaaS Sales Models to Boost Revenue
Updated On: August 4, 2024
13 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-saas-sales-model)

When it comes to software, it seems like we’re all moving to SaaS. [Dealroom reports](https://dealroom.co/guides/saas) that 47% of all venture capital in 2023 was invested in SaaS platforms. 


This is because SaaS outsources traditional software's limitations (updating, installation, integration), making adoption more manageable, flexible, and cost-effective. 


However, your sales team might need help mapping a new sales process tied to subscription-based software–help outlining a unique value proposition, tracking metrics, or looking for ways to upsell an existing customer base.


This article discusses the four best sales models for B2B SaaS products and how they can help you pivot your sales know-how into one of the biggest markets in tech.


##How Is SaaS Sales Different From Traditional Sales Models?
Businesses love SaaS tools because they are easy. Do you want to stay flexible? Cloud tools can help. Want to get an entire team onboarded quickly? SaaS solutions make it easy. Need to get away from downloadables, updates, and patches? SaaS is the way. 


These reasons are probably why [99% of companies will use at least one SaaS solution by the end of 2024](https://www.saasacademy.com/blog/saas-statistics). 


How does SaaS make all of this possible?


- 
They are a move to subscription-based purchases rather than one-time purchases. Rather than licensing and downloads, SaaS solutions rely on monthly or annual payments, providing more opportunities to upgrade or upsell paying customers.


- 
SaaS deployment provides always-on web services via a web browser. This makes software much more accessible (everyone has a web browser) and minimizes the need for users to update or upgrade software constantly.


- 
SaaS includes a maintenance model that outsources critical functions like updates, upgrades, or security and compliance issues to the software provider. 



And when the technology changes, sales will follow. Instead of focusing on a one-time transactional sales model, your sales team will look at a shorter sales cycle and a revenue model reflecting earnings over time rather than at the point of sale.  


Additionally, new features can translate into new subscription tiers, providing sales teams plenty of opportunities to upsell existing customers.


###B2B vs. B2C SaaS Sales
B2B SaaS sales will focus on account-based relationships. Instead of seeking mass licenses from a wide range of customers, you’ll look to sell ongoing packages of services and software that fulfill daily enterprise needs. 


It’s not just about enterprise users, however. Many small- and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) need comprehensive packages with the flexibility to adjust pricing tiers and features monthly or annually. 


##The SaaS Sales Process

There are hundreds of SaaS solutions available for both general consumers and business customers… This market grew to the tune of $101.47B in 2023 and is expected to top[ $400B in the next decade](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/software-as-a-service-market#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20software%20as%20a,13.5%25%20from%202024%20to%202034.). That means that there is plenty of room to stake your claim with the right features. 


The B2B SaaS sales process is similar to a traditional sales pipeline, albeit considering the unique contours of a SaaS product. 


###Stage 1: Lead Generation
Lead generation (or lead gen) is critical to the B2B SaaS sales process and extends across several contexts and situations. The full scope of lead gen can include:


- 
Inbound marketing, covering targeted SaaS marketing, SEO content development, webinars, and other indirect approaches that raise your product or brand profile.


- 
Outbound prospecting usually includes email campaigns, social media outreach, and participation in SaaS industry events to connect with potential customers and nurture them through a CRM or Artisan's [AI SDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).



In either case, lead generation efforts should align with your existing Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), which should model new customers and those likely to stay with a product for a long-term commitment. 


###Stage 2: Lead Qualification
Lead qualification is a foundational part of any sales pipeline. Potential leads should be scored and ranked based on their alignment with your ICP and organizational goals, with metrics including behavioral traits, financial or professional situations, or demographics. 


One criteria to use in qualifying leads is the Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline (BANT) approach:


- 
Budget: What is the customer’s budget for a SaaS solution? Is it readily available, and are there any financial constraints?


- 
Authority: Are you engaging with someone who can make purchasing decisions? Are there one or multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process?


- 
Need: What needs does your SaaS solution meet for the customer, and how critical is adoption in terms of time or costs?


- 
Timeline: When will the customer be ready to make a purchase? How long do they have for implementation?


###Stage 3: Product Demonstration
Product demos are among the most valuable and practical sales tools available. [The SaaStr community](https://www.saastr.com/what-is-a-good-demo-conversion-rate-for-saas-startup/#:~:text=10%25%2D20%25.,%2D15%20is%20pretty%20common).) reports that the average conversion rate for a product demo is up to 20%—not too bad for a single asset. 


However, not all product demos are created equal. A generic demo can bounce a potential lead faster than anything else. Make sure to customize demos to speak directly to important features to customers (or customer segments). Think interactivity and hands-on demonstrations that show rather than tell. 


Answer questions about how your product:


- 
Simplifies or streamlines everyday tasks for the customer. 


- 
Increases productivity through automation or customization.


- 
Reduces costs by providing better functionality than their existing solution at a lower price point. 


- 
Eases use through onboarding and white-glove support. 



Often, a demo can include a free or “freemium” version of your SaaS solution that a lead can use on their own time and terms. 


###Stage 4: Proposal and Negotiation
While submitting a proposal might seem like the final step of the sales process, it is better to see this as the first step in negotiations. 


Any reasonable proposal should include some standard information, including:


- 
An outline of the terms of the relationship and the features and capabilities you are delivering to solve specific problems.


- 
Deliverables like access to the product, any white-glove customer support services, credits, and so on.


- 
A timeline for these deliverables, including immediate next steps.


- 
Pricing, payment terms, and deadlines.


- 
Case studies and testimonials that demonstrate costs, ROI, etc.



Once the proposal has been submitted, internal stakeholders will likely have questions about the SaaS solution, such as prices, availability, usefulness, etc. These buyers are making a long-term commitment, and you should be ready and patient with these questions. 


###Stage 5: Closing Deals
The proposal has been submitted, questions answered, and now both parties have reached what seems like a deal–if you can close it. 


You want to “seal the deal” with an agreement at this stage. Everything, including contracts or paperwork, should be worked out. Many modern companies use digital solutions like DocuSign or Dropbox to allow customers to sign documents automatically. 


Free or freemium access to your software can create real urgency for your lead to close. If they like it, losing access (or even having limited access) can light a fire under them to close the deal and get their team on the platform.


##Stage 6: Onboarding and Implementation
Finally, once the customer is signed on, provide ongoing support. This should include:


- 
Training resources and an easily accessible knowledge base.


- 
On-call support from your customer service staff. 


- 
A dedicated contact point for your customers to ensure they can get problems addressed quickly.


- 
IT support to help customers adopt the solution or integrate it with their existing tech stack. 


##4 Popular B2B SaaS Sales Models for SaaS Companies

Some of the steps previously covered in the sales process are true for both SaaS and traditional tech companies. However, several models you can build into a more extensive sales pipeline can bring you significant success in your target market. 


###Self-Serve Model
This approach allows potential customers to sign up for your SaaS product without directly interacting with your sales team. On the surface, giving them a way to avoid the sales team seems like a bad idea, but it reduces the friction leads might feel when they wish to learn about a product. This can make trying and purchasing easy–just provide that, and it will lead to some easy-to-understand pricing models and let them create their accounts. 


This approach typically includes a freemium model, with a free-to-use tier with limited functionality leading into higher Premium, Business, or Enterprise tiers. 


Examples: Dropbox, Slack


###Freemium Model with Upsell
A version of the self-service model, offering a freemium with an upsell, allows users to interact with the product but adds urgency to the upsell. This urgency can come from a time-limited access window to limited feature sets. 


The upsell will often come from the time or need urgency (sign up for full access) and can include email nurture campaigns and in-app alerts. 


Examples: Zoom, Mailchimp, LinkedIn


###Usage-Based Model
Some cloud tools track resources with a metered approach. Users can take advantage of some or all of a SaaS solution’s features and pay as they use bandwidth or storage. This can be a great sales incentive for organizations that want to use or build SaaS tools in a cloud infrastructure environment. 


Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Digital Ocean 


###Enterprise Sales Model
We’ve previously given examples of relatively simple SaaS products. The model gets slightly more complex regarding more advanced enterprise SaaS platforms with dozens or hundreds of features. The enterprise model focuses on selling large-scale cloud solutions that involve several layers of proposals, approvals, and customer touchpoints. 


This model calls for account representatives with a deep knowledge of their target industry. It may involve several sales process stages, including additional presentations, demonstrations, sample projects, and negotiations. 


Examples: Workday, SAP, Salesforce


##B2B SaaS Sales Strategy for Success
A B2B sales strategy will depend on how your sales team articulates the value of your SaaS product to decision-makers throughout the process. 


###Craft a Compelling Value Proposition

Understanding and articulating your value proposition is the key to any successful sales approach. The value proposition tells the customer what you can give them and how it can solve their specific problems.


A good value proposition should include a list of key features and an apparent narrative explaining how those features benefit the customer. 


Additionally, your Unique Selling Points (USPs) are just as important as the value proposition. These are how you differentiate your SaaS product from competitors and provide proof of success. For example, you might provide customers with a comparison table highlighting key features against competitors or use customer stories to show leads that the product fits specific niches and use cases.  


Finally, use automated personalized outreach via AI SDRs like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) to bring data to your messaging and help you craft a compelling value proposition.

###Demonstrate Value Throughout the SaaS Sales Cycle
The sales cycle should include a consistent and ongoing reaffirmation of your product's value. This affirmation should include a broad set of examples of how your product addresses specific needs and pain points. 


Some common ways to accomplish this include:


- 
Demos. Targeted, strategic demonstrations of product features can be critical throughout the process. By both providing generalized demonstrations and setting up feature- and industry-specific demos, you can ensure that any stakeholder who needs a reminder of your value has the chance to get one.


- 
Case Studies. Case studies provide critical narratives about your product to your potential leads. These studies show buyers can trust your SaaS solution to fit their needs. Create downloadable PDFs and include them on your website and as part of any email nurture campaigns.


- 
Customer Stories. Customer stories are often less formal than case studies but can provide key social proof that your product solves real problems in real-life situations. Downloadable one-sheet stories can be an easy way to distribute these materials, and video testimonials can add that critical human touch.


- 
Free Trials. Offering a free trial or freemium version of your product lets customers see the value of your product themselves. It also gives your salespeople a “hands-free” way to engage while they focus on follow-ups or upselling.


- 
The Proposal. The proposal gives you space to demonstrate value through some of the techniques we’ve discussed. By including testimonials, customer stories, and use cases alongside demos, you can provide a package that keeps the value of your product front and center, even in the later stages of the sales pipeline.


###Track and Analyze Key Metrics for SaaS Business

So, how do you measure success? With traditional software, this poses a more straightforward challenge to sales and revenue. However, with B2B SaaS solutions, these metrics are slightly different. 


- 
Conversion rates of leads to customers. It seems obvious enough, but you must understand how many leads are coming through the pipeline. It also helps to understand the sales cycle length and how long it takes to move a lead from first contact to closing the sale.


- 
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) measure how sales translate to ongoing subscription revenue.


- 
Customer acquisition costs (CAC) related to sales efforts can tell you the price tag for each customer exactly. This, in turn, can help you better understand how to optimize costs and measure success as acquisition costs against potential monthly revenue.


- 
A high churn rate can be a major revenue problem. Churn and customer retention rates are critical for sales professionals in B2B SaaS because they are responsible for maintaining their customer base and, ideally, upselling them into higher subscription tiers.


- 
Combining user revenue with the average customer lifetime allows you to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which helps with long-term projections regarding your company’s value.


##How AI Can Optimize Your B2B SaaS Sales
AI is changing the name of the game in most industries, and B2B SaaS sales aren’t any different. New intelligent automation and creative, generative AI are shaping how and with what quality salespeople can engage with leads throughout their pipeline. These impacts include:


- 
Task automation is based on where a lead is in their journey, any actions they’ve taken, or demographic information.


- 
More effective lead generation and qualification leveraging AI-driven insights.


- 
Creative input on messaging, email nurturing, and personalized engagement with generative AI.



AI integration in SaaS sales goes beyond automation. It's reshaping lead scoring, personalizing outreach, and predicting customer behavior. AI SDRs like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent) can analyze engagement patterns, suggest optimal messaging, and even conduct initial conversations. This allows sales teams to focus on high-value interactions and complex deal-closing activities.


The future of B2B SaaS sales lies in adaptability. As markets evolve, successful teams will blend traditional sales skills with data-driven insights and AI-powered tools. They'll need to stay agile, continuously refine their strategies, and focus on delivering measurable value to customers. By embracing these changes, SaaS companies can build more efficient, effective sales processes that drive sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive landscape.

#Lead Generation Outsourcing: A Complete Guide
Updated On: July 23, 2024
14 min read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/lead-generation-outsourcing)

If you’re thinking of outsourcing lead generation, you’re not alone. By 2030, the outsourcing market is expected to [reach 512.4 billion USD](https://digitalmindsbpo.com/blog/outsourcing-statistics/).


Lead generation is vital to growing your business, but your sales team doesn’t always have the capacity – especially with ongoing labor shortages. So, what can you do? Outsourcing can help.


Increasingly, advanced AI is assisting businesses in identifying qualified leads at scale without breaking the bank or overtaxing their employees. In fact, [25% of companies report](https://hatchworks.com/blog/software-development/generative-ai-statistics/) that AI helps fill gaps that exist due to a lack of human capacity and [43% of representatives](https://sellingsignals.com/lead-generation-statistics/) believe that AI positively impacts their performance.



From HubSpot’s 2024 Sales Trends Report


In 2024, outsourcing will be a key component of lead generation campaigns, with AI assistance and automation becoming the norm. That being said, outsourcing isn’t right for every company.


So, let’s break down the pros and cons of outsourcing lead generation to help you decide if it’s the right choice for your team.


##Transitioning to Outsourcing: Key Factors to Consider
###Defining Your Outsourcing and In-House Lead Generation Models
So, should you keep your lead generation process in house or look into outside lead generation services? There’s no one-size-fits all solution.


In-house lead generation offers many benefits, such as:


- 
More direct control of your company’s vision and brand


- 
Increased alignment between sales and marketing, which can deepen your understanding of target audiences


- 
Internal teams with built-in knowledge of your company can help better tailor campaigns, draft copy, and produce marketing materials



However, maintaining an in-house lead generation team requires significant investments in recruitment, training, technology, ongoing management, and so on.


For small businesses, startups, and others with limited bandwidth, outsourcing can be a gamechanger.



From McKinsey & Company’s “New B2B Growth Equation”


Additionally, B2B companies in particular may benefit from lead outsourcing. The B2B market is getting tougher. According to McKinsey, B2B buyers’ expectations [have skyrocketed in recent years](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-new-b2b-growth-equation), with consumers demanding more and more personalized experiences.


In a hyper-competitive market, casting a wide net is crucial. However, it’s not an easy task when customers expect a customized shopping experience. Lead outsourcing can help by:


- 
Specialized agents focus exclusively on finding you quality leads, offloading work from your in-house team


- 
Your in-house team can instead spend time crafting personalized sales and marketing campaigns to appeal to buyers one-on-one



In a nutshell, outsourcing brings in expertise, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. If your company lacks specific resources, outsourcing agencies have access to advanced tools that allow them to execute targeted campaigns efficiently.


Ultimately, the decision between in-house and outsourcing models depends on your unique circumstances and sales and marketing objectives.


###Identifying Triggers for Shifting to Outsourcing
Lead generation can be a major bottleneck for business growth. Identifying potential customers can take hours of valuable time away from your sales team.


Are your current resources are unable to keep up with your lead generation needs? Consider the following:


- 
Do you need to scale lead generation quickly? Lead-gen scalability is notoriously tough, especially without outside help. In an unpredictable market especially, outsourcing allows you to scale lead generation flexibly as circumstances change.


- 
Do you want to improve the quality of your leads? When your sales team is responsible for everything from drafting emails to cold calling, they might not have adequate time for lead generation. Outsourcing can help you better connect with your target market, ultimately increasing conversion rates.


- 
Do you lack internal resources? Lead generation is time-consuming, especially with an overtaxed team. If your marketing and sales initiatives are struggling to connect with your target audience due to capacity constraints, you may need to bring in outside help.


- 
Are you looking to reduce costs? While many people assume outsourcing is pricey, it can actually reduce costs. Leveraging the expertise and technology of specialized agencies eliminates the need for many in-house investments.


##Pros & Cons of Outsourcing Your Lead Generation
While outsourcing can help with scalability and give your sales and marketing teams extra expertise and experience, it also means sacrificing some control and dealing with potential communication barriers.


Let’s take a quick look at the drawbacks and benefits of outsourcing lead generation.


###Pros
####Expertise and Experience
A good outsourcing partner can bring invaluable knowledge to the table. Rather than focusing on all aspects of the sales funnel, you’re working with individuals hyper-focused on lead generation.


Service providers focus solely on connecting you with the best potential clients, handing your salespeople those leads most likely to convert.


####Cost-Effective
It might sound cliche, but outsourcing lead generation often pays for itself when it’s done right.


When working with a quality agency, outsourcing can improve vital metrics and KPIs while cutting back on costs like recruitment, training, and in-house employees.


####Scalability
As noted above, lead generation can be a barrier to scaling your sales pipeline. If you don’t have adequate time to devote to lead generation, outreach suffers. Connecting with lower quality leads is a massive waste of everyone’s time and resources.


Outsourcing lead generation allows you to to easily adjust resources based on demand without needing to internally hire or train staff.


####Quick Implementation
Lead generation agencies can get campaigns up and running much faster than in-house teams. The sales process is time consuming. Chances are, your reps have a hundred things on their plate without having to worry about rolling out a lead generation strategy.


But an outsourced team specializing in lead generation? They have the time and resources to implement lead generation efforts fast.


####Focus on Core Business
With lead generation handled by outsiders, your sales team can better focus on core business needs.


Rather than wasting hours crafting an ideal customer profile and identifying key decision-makers to contact, your sales reps can instead spend time honing their people skills, preparing for calls, fine-tuning marketing efforts, and more.


###Cons
####Less Control
First, the obvious – you’re placing a lot of trust in an outside party with lead generation.


You’re relinquishing autonomy in decision-making, campaign execution, data management, and more. You may struggle to keep your brand voice intact when you’re delegating tasks to individuals outside your company.


####Quality Concerns
An outsourcing company might bring in a ton of sales leads, but are they the right leads for your goals? If you’re working with an outside company with values that don’t align with your own, you might end up with a subpar list of contacts.


Additionally, external agencies sometimes prioritize quantity rather than quality in order to meet contractual quotas.


####Communication Barriers
Effective communication is essential for a good lead generation strategy, but unfortunately this doesn’t always go smoothly. Factors like geographic distance, time zone differences, and even small cultural nuances can impede effective collaboration.


When looking for an outsourcing company, prioritize finding a company with values that mesh with your own and be proactive about facilitating conversation.


####Data Security
Let’s be honest – trust is paramount when you’re outsourcing any aspect of your business’s operations. Outsourcing requires sharing sensitive customer data with external agencies, which naturally raises concerns about data security.


Handing over data to third parties can increase the risk of security breaches, impacting your company’s reputation.


####Dependency
Intentional or not, outsourcing can create over-dependence on external agencies. This is a huge strategic risk for businesses.


Relying too much on a third party can limit the development of your internal team, hindering innovation in lead generation over time. Not to mention that if your outsourcing partnership dissolves for any reason, you may be left scrambling to fill the gaps.


##Choosing the Right Lead Generation Partner
The above drawbacks shouldn’t scare you away from outsourcing lead generation. Rather, they should give you a better sense of how to choose the right partner.


Below are a few things to consider when picking an agency to collaborate with.


###Industry Knowledge and Expertise
Does an outsourcing company have experience finding leads from your niche or industry? If not, they’re unlikely to be the right partner for your team.


Ideally, you should look for companies with experience working in your specific industry so they understand the messaging most likely to resonate with high-quality leads.


Look for hard proof a company is successful in your industry. Case studies, customer reviews, and hard metrics can help you determine if a company’s worth the investment.


###Transparency of Strategies
You want to work with a company that is dedicated to transparency when it comes to lead generation. Vague content marketing materials claiming to yield a high number of leads don’t tell you much.


Instead, look for specifics:


- 
Are companies being upfront not only about their results but how they achieved them?


- 
Are they showing off materials like email marketing templates, LinkedIn posts, outreach strategies, and more to prove they can connect with your ICP?


###Customized Solutions
The best outsourcing companies understand there aren’t one-size-fits all methods. Companies should offer customized solutions that work for not only your specific industry but your company’s individual goals and needs.


B2B lead generation strategies differ vastly from the B2C or D2C sector, for example. You don’t want a partner who’s a one-trick pony.


The best partners:


- 
Take time to understand your target audience, brand voice, and brand goals


- 
Have demonstrable experience working with a variety of businesses


- 
Have delivered solid results across a diverse range of sectors


- 
Look beyond conventional lead generation methods and prioritize cutting-edge technologies and out-of-the-box marketing strategies.


###Lead Quality and Conversion Potential
You want a partner that prioritizes quality over quantity (albeit, while also bringing in a high number of leads). A good lead generation partner should have a history of helping companies identify leads with needs that align closely with their offerings.


It’s not always easy to immediately gauge an outsourcing company’s skill here. Obviously, reviews that mention quality leads are a great sign, but look into harder metrics too:


- 
Can a company provide you information about their lead scoring methodologies?


- 
If you ask hyper-specific questions about your industry during initial consultations, can company representatives answer easily?



Asking these questions ensures a company has the expertise necessary to track down quality leads with high conversion potential.


###Clear Contract and Pricing Models
We hate to sound like a broken record, but a good lead generation partnership boils down to trust. A good partner will be completely transparent about their contract and pricing models. This ensures mutual understanding of your goals, prevents misunderstandings or disagreements, and helps foster a streamlined process for all parties involved.


A good outsourcing company should:


- 
Clearly outline deliverables, timelines, and the respective responsibilities of both parties


- 
List pricing models both in the contract and on the company website


- 
Let you know exactly what you’re paying for, whether it’s a fixed fee or a performance-based arrangement


###Compliance with Data Privacy Models
Compliance with privacy laws is non-negotiable. The costs can be devastating to both your company’s reputation and revenue. According to Harvard Business Review, publicly traded companies suffer an average [7.5% decrease in stock value post-data breach](https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach) and audit fees for companies are 13.5% higher post-data breach.


When you’re handing over data to a third party, you need to ensure they’re up-to-date with all regulations and have a solid plan in place to ensure customer privacy:


- 
Does your partner have a clear understanding of national, international, and regional regulations?


- 
Can they provide you with detailed information about their data handling practices and security measures?


- 
Are they transparent on their website about these procedures?


###Proven Track Record
Can your outsourcing partner put their money where their mouth is? Anyone can make vague claims about their abilities, but you’ll need to see hard facts before committing. Scan a company’s website and social media to see what materials they have speaking to their efficacy.


The more concrete, measurable details the better:


- 
Can a company provide you with client testimonials, references, and performance metrics?


- 
Do they have a history of long-term partnerships?



You want to work with a company that has a consistent, documented history of delivering results over time and keeping customers happy.


##How Much Does It Cost to Outsource Lead Generation?
Obviously, cost is a huge factor for companies considering outsourcing lead generation. So, let’s take a look at how to estimate costs to help you decide if outsourcing is a feasible option.


###Cost Per Lead
Cost Per Lead (CPL) [varies greatly by industry](https://www.unboundb2b.com/blog/outsourcing-lead-generation/). Technology and healthcare fall on the higher end of the spectrum, with averages of $208 and $162 respectively. Retail and non-profits, on the other hand, can fall as low as $34 and $31 respectively.


###Pricing Models
Every agency will have [their own pricing mode](https://salesroads.com/outsourcing/sales-outsourcing-pricing/)l.


Some charge hourly rates, usually falling between $25 to $50 per hour. Some charge pay-per-performance, where you’re only charged for booked appointments.


Costs here can vary a lot by company. Some companies, usually those that offer customized solutions, work on a retainer basis with fees that start around $8,000.


###Average Cost
Across all industries, the average CPL comes to [around $198](https://www.unboundb2b.com/blog/outsourcing-lead-generation/). However, as stated, some industries are pricier than others. Additionally, high-quality verified leads tend to cost more.


###Factors Influencing Cost
It’s hard to make blanket claims about the cost of lead generation. Individual factors make a huge difference. Everything from the complexity of your campaign to the level of industry competition to your project size impacts your final pricing.


Using AI Sales Agents like [Ava from Artisan AI](/ai-sales-agent) can hugely cut back on costs, with fees starting at just $225 per month. [Learn more here.](/talk-to-sales)


##How To Measure the Success of Outsourced Lead Generation
If you decide outsourcing lead generation is right for you, you’ll want to make sure it’s actually cost-effective long term. To measure the success of your outsourced lead generation efforts, consider these key performance indicators (KPIs) and methods:


- 
Cost Per Lead (CPL): Calculate the cost spent on the campaign divided by the number of leads generated to measure efficiency and budget alignment.


- 
Lead Conversion Rate: Track the percentage of leads that become qualified prospects and then customers, indicating the quality of leads.


- 
Return on Investment (ROI): Assess the revenue generated from the leads compared to the cost of the outsourcing service to determine profitability.


- 
Sales Growth: Monitor any increases in sales volume that correlate with the start of the lead generation campaign, indicating overall effectiveness.


- 
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Measure the revenue a customer is expected to generate throughout their relationship with your company, indicating long-term value from leads.

#10 Best Outbound Sales Software & Tools for SDRs
Updated On: July 23, 2024
13 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/outbound-sales-software)

How many tools do you need in your tech stack? According to Gartner, a robust revenue tech stack should include [six core groups](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/trends/modern-sales-tech-stack) of technologies for engagement, application, enablement, revenue operations, infrastructure, and data enrichment. 


That’s a lot of money, huh?



The good news is, that you don’t have to pay for six platforms to streamline your outbound sales process and beyond. You only need one to three tools to consolidate all these features.


To help you do more with less, we’ve hand-picked the 10 best outbound sales software for different tasks and needs.


##1. Artisan

[Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/) is more than just a tool for SDRs — it's like having an SDR, BDR, and all-in-one outbound sales automation software in one.


Meet Ava, the AI SDR by Artisan, who automates 80% of the outbound sales process. 


In just a 10-minute conversation, Ava learns about your ideal customer profile (ICP) and product. Once she understands your needs, she creates an outbound campaign, selects potential leads from her database of over 270 million contacts, and starts prospecting. Alternatively, you can complete the setup process in the campaign editor—Ava will pick up the directions from there.


Artisan collects data from a wide range of sources to deliver the most relevant B2B information about your prospects. It scrapes partner data, major social media channels like LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as industry tracking sites like Crunchbase. Ava uses this data to enrich your lead profiles and craft hyper-personalized messages for each.


###Key features 
- 
Ava, the AI sales agent, acts as an intelligent sales representative, handling much of the outbound process.


- 
Sales automation streamlines key SDR processes like lead research, personalized sales outreach, email writing, deliverability optimization, etc.


- 
Sales playbooks define the writing style, tone of voice, and content of your outbound emails.


- 
Lead enrichment keeps your lead profiles updated with relevant data.


- 
AI-driven email warmup boosts your sender reputation and increases the deliverability of your emails.


###Why choose Artisan
- 
Automation across your entire outbound cycle.


- 
No need to increase headcount to scale outbound SDR.


- 
Hyper-personalized, AI-driven research workflows.


- 
Consistent messaging across all of your emails.


- 
The capability to scrape leads’ social media posts and recognize intent signals.


- 
The only sales software that automates personalized email writing with dynamic email playbooks emulating any style a human BDR would write in.


- 
As an early-stage startup, Artisan can build features upon request and work with sales teams as design partners.


###Artisan’s limitations
- 
While Artisan is growing rapidly, it still lacks some features.


- 
Compared to basic sales automation software, Artisan’s pricing is less affordable.


##2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator

If you do prospecting on LinkedIn, this is likely the first software option that comes to mind—and for good reason.


LinkedIn Sales Navigator is LinkedIn's native sales tool for prospecting and relationship building. It's an excellent choice for small and mid-sized businesses looking for their first SDR tool.


The platform provides access to numerous features and filters that simplify the lead search process. You can use advanced search filters for criteria such as recent job changes, seniority level, and companies with job openings, in addition to standard filters like job title and industry. 


Once you've identified potential leads, you can create prospect lists, set up alerts to track their activity or start outreach campaigns immediately.



###Key features
- 
Advanced LinkedIn search filters allow SDRs to find the right leads quickly.


- 
Alerts and real-time updates help to keep track of changes in lead data.


- 
Buyer Intent signals when leads interact with the business’s LinkedIn company page or company website.


- 
InMail messaging enables direct communication with prospects outside your network.


- 
CRM integration ensures seamless syncing of lead data with your existing sales tools.


- 
TeamLink analyzes your entire team’s network to identify hidden paths to make warm introductions.


- 
Saved Searches enable you to save your search criteria and receive updates when new leads match your filters.


###Why choose LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- 
Access to LinkedIn’s extensive professional network.


- 
No need to navigate third-party interfaces to find and connect with your LinkedIn leads.


- 
A relatively affordable solution compared to many outbound automation tools.


- 
Advanced filters, saved searches, and alerts present more opportunities to source qualified leads than with a basic LinkedIn account.


- 
Easy integration with most tools in your tech stack.


###LinkedIn Sales Navigator’s limitations
- 
Full CRM integration is only available with the Advanced Plus plan (an enterprise-level package).


- 
The monthly limit of 50 InMail messages across all plans is rather restrictive.


- 
You have to perform all the processes manually.


#3. Salesforce

Does it even need an introduction? This well-known sales software has been a powerhouse for over two decades.


While it's not cheap and requires significant setup, it's incredibly powerful for mid-sized and large sales teams. Salesforce’s all-in-one CRM solution, Sales Cloud, is highly customizable to meet any business needs and includes various sales automation tools. 


Mind that Salesforce’s flexibility comes with high setup costs and a steep learning curve. It’s not another out-of-the-box solution you can log into and start prospecting. While Salesforce can handle outbound sales, that's not its main draw. Businesses choose Salesforce for its ability to automate complex sales cycles, where its complexity really pays off.


Salesforce also offers Einstein Copilot, an AI assistant designed to tackle repetitive tasks. It can generate emails, answer questions about your performance, help you prioritize leads, update your pipeline, and more.



###Key features
- 
A highly customizable CRM system grows with your sales team.


- 
A comprehensive sales automation tech stack empowers salespeople through every process, from outbound lead generation to revenue analytics. 


- 
Integration capabilities with various business applications allow you to seamlessly sync Salesforce data with other business tools and systems.


- 
Einstein Copilot AI assistant enables task automation and provides quick insights.


###Why choose Salesforce
- 
An advanced platform that has everything you need (given that you build it by yourself).


- 
Salesforce can be heavily adjusted to meet your business needs and processes.


- 
It can become your central business data hub, collecting and processing information from various sources.


###Salesforce’s limitations
- 
Pricing builds up really quickly as many features are available as add-ons, including the AI copilot.


- 
Software is complex, leading to a more extensive setup and onboarding process in comparison to simpler sales software.


- 
Salesforce doesn't provide you with B2B leads data. You'll need to go for 3rd-party providers.



[💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb) Tip: The integration between Artisan and Salesforce compensates for the lack of a lead database in Salesforce. You can use Ava to find and qualify leads; then, smoothly move these engaged prospects into your Salesforce CRM. [Try it now.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)


##4. Pipedrive

Like Salesforce, Pipedrive isn’t exactly an outbound prospecting tool. It’s a sales automation and pipeline management tool with the capability to build outbound workflows. 


In Pipedrive, sales teams can handle leads and deals from beginning to end. However, contrary to Salesforce, it’s also more intuitive and out-of-the-box (and, therefore, less flexible).


For SDRs, the platform provides convenient task reminders, triggered messages, automated follow-ups, and an AI sales assistant. Pipedrive's AI enhances outbound workflows with actions like recommending high-potential deals and suggesting priority actions to streamline sales processes.


###Key features
- 
Email outreach tools simplify the creation and sending of bulk emails, along with setting up automated email sequences.


- 
The meeting scheduler integrates with your calendar, allowing hot leads to book calls with sales agents instantly. 


- 
Lead management helps to qualify, track, and prioritize potential customers semi-automatically.


- 
Customizable pipelines allow you to implement your ideal sales process by creating custom lead paths and goals.


- 
Team collaboration supports smooth communication and teamwork among sales reps.


- 
Detailed performance reports offer insights into your leads-to-deals conversion rates, deal velocity, team effectiveness, revenue forecasts, and other critical data.  


- 
AI-powered sales assistant augments all of the features above. 


###Why choose Pipedrive
- 
Ideal for managing your entire sales process, from prospecting to closing deals.


- 
Among the most affordable software options available.


- 
Perfect for beginners and small businesses looking to streamline sales operations.


###Pipedrive’s limitations
- 
Pipedrive doesn’t fully automate outbound prospecting. You need to handle most of the process manually.


- 
While a decent option for driving existing leads through the funnel, it doesn’t offer the tools for rapidly building a pipeline, such as lead research and comprehensive data sources.


##5. HubSpot

HubSpot completes the roster of mainstream sales software in our lineup. Known for its suite of sales and marketing tools, HubSpot is often compared to Salesforce in its robustness and comprehensiveness, but as a more out-of-the-box solution.


It simplifies outbound sales efforts with features like customizable email templates, sales automation workflows, and performance insights. It also integrates with a wide range of tools, including Artisan and LinkedIn Sales Navigator—so you can identify and capture leads on autopilot and instantly forward them to HubSpot CRM.


HubSpot integrates with Artisan. If you need a solution to automatically generate qualified leads and nurture them through a centralized CRM system, it’s a match made in heaven. [Try Artisan now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent).



###HubSpot features
- 
Email marketing capabilities facilitate the creation, sending, and tracking of outreach emails.


- 
Sales automation workflows minimize manual tasks with scheduled email sequences, follow-ups, etc.


- 
Call tracking functionality is enhanced by AI-powered conversation intelligence that provides you with insights based on your call recordings.


- 
CRM functionality centralizes lead nurturing and sales processes under one roof.


- 
Sales analytics gives you a grasp of the overall health of your sales pipeline.


- 
HubSpot AI helps you draft engaging cold emails. 


###Why choose HubSpot
- 
A comprehensive platform for teams looking for a tool to manage the entire sales process from start to finish.


- 
HubSpot CRM is available for free with limited features, making it an excellent choice for small businesses with simpler sales processes.


- 
Ideal for businesses needing a sales automation tool that integrates effortlessly with their existing tech stack.


- 
Provides tools for customer support and marketing teams alongside sales features, making it easy to coordinate efforts across different departments.


###HubSpot’s limitations
- 
While the basic CRM is free, paid plans quickly increase in cost with advanced features and add-ons.


- 
HubSpot doesn’t offer integrated data sources and automated prospecting solutions.


##6. Growbots

Shifting away from conventional sales CRMs, Growbots specializes in dedicated prospecting software designed for small businesses.


The platform automates outbound sales processes like prospect search, lead enrichment, email sequences, follow-ups, and more. 


The search filters are particularly handy; in addition to basic criteria like company size and industry, they allow you to identify qualified leads based on factors such as funding rounds and the technologies used on their company websites.



###Growbots features
- 
Prospecting tools find and qualify potential leads based on your ICP.


- 
The outreach platform automates and speeds up your lead outreach and nurturing workflows.


- 
Email warm-up service develops your sender reputation and improves cold email deliverability.


- 
Email health check is an additional service provided by Growbots for those needing help maintaining sender account compliance.


- 
Concierge is another extra service by Growbots that allows you to outsource your outbound sales efforts.


###Why choose Growbots
- 
Access to over 180 million verified contacts for targeted outreach.


- 
Laser-focused on automating prospecting and outbound processes.


- 
Small business owners will benefit from the ability to consult SDR pros.


###Growbots’s limitations
- 
Lacks advanced AI functionalities seen in some competitors.


- 
Limited integration options.


- 
Users get charged every time they send an email—so it's not very scalable.


##7. Lusha

Lusha is a B2B sales prospecting platform with many blows and whistles. 


At the heart of Lusha's capabilities lies its database of 135 million verified B2B leads. Once you’ve specified your ideal audience with advanced search filters, Lusha searches its database and pinpoints buyers who are most likely to convert.


Initially designed as a lead finder, Lusha has expanded its platform to include email engagement functionality. With it, you can reach out to prospects using basic automated email campaigns.


###Key features 
- 
Prospecting filters range from tracking recent job changes to analyzing companies’ tech stacks and predicting conversion likelihood.


- 
Contact enrichment adds detailed contact information directly into your CRM or sales tools.


- 
Email engagement tools automate outreach with targeted email sequences.


- 
Lusha Extension’s contact finder lets you find contact details directly from LinkedIn profiles and other websites.


- 
Prospecting API allows you to easily update and enrich large amounts of lead data in your CRM.


###Why choose Lusha
- 
Fully eliminates the need to search for leads manually.


- 
Claims compliance with the world's highest international privacy standards.


- 
SDRs mainly favor Lusha for its browser extension, simplifying contact extraction from LinkedIn profiles.


- 
User-friendly setup and operation, suitable for all experience levels.


###Lusha’s limitations
- 
Unlike Artisan and Growbots, Lusha lacks email deliverability tools. 


- 
It isn't powered by AI, which also means it doesn’t assist you with email outreach or optimize its prospecting workflows automatically.


##8. Apollo

At its core, much like Artisan, Growbots, and Lusha, Apollo features a vast database of verified B2B contacts. What sets Apollo apart is its integration of prospecting tools with end-to-end sales automation capabilities, including deal management and full-funnel automation workflows.


Apollo also facilitates cold calls with its built-in click-to-call dialer and conversation intelligence. The platform records phone calls, transcribes them, extracts AI insights, and syncs the data to your CRM.

Apollo’s email engagement suite doesn’t include a warmup feature.


- 
The wide array of tools may feel confusing, especially if you don’t need all of them.


- 
Help content isn’t comprehensive enough to smoothly navigate Apollo’s functionality.


##9. Close

Close is a small business CRM solution with dedicated outbound sales tools.


With Close, you can create automated workflows with custom follow-up email sequences, cadences, and triggers. It also supports built-in calling features like a power dialer, predictive dialer, call coaching, and recording.


The call coaching feature is particularly noteworthy as it allows you to train or assist your sales reps during live calls. You can listen in, whisper advice, or join the call based on the rep’s needs.



###Key features
- 
Workflow automation doubles the productivity of SDRs and sales reps with multichannel sequences and automated follow-ups.

- 
As a small business CRM, it lacks flexibility for custom needs.


##10. Gong

Gong is a sales intelligence platform designed for mid-sized businesses.


Data is Gong's strongest asset. Its AI-driven analytics and extended forecasting functionality make it a top choice for data-driven sales teams. 


On top of that, users particularly appreciate the call recording feature with AI follow-ups. The platform records, transcribes, and analyzes every call, then suggests AI-generated emails to follow up with leads.


###Key features
- 
Email engagement tools help you design, launch, and track email interactions with prospects.

#B2B Sales KPIs: A Guide to Growth Metrics That Matter
Updated On: August 2, 2024
13 minutes read
[](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-sales-kpis)

If you shudder a little when you hear the acronym “KPI”, you’re in good company. For many marketers and salespeople, those three little letters are an ill omen. 


Sales KPIs are important. But only when they truly help drive revenue. You’re already gasping for air in a rising tide of data. And you’re not going to hit your growth and revenue goals with unnecessary additions to your crowded analytics dashboard. 


We get it. That’s why we’ve got a zero-tolerance approach to vanity metrics that exist solely to fill out largely meaningless performance reports.  


We’ll cover KPIs that actually generate sales growth and align with your business goals. Crucially, we’ll explain why they’re important and how they can help you and your team make better decisions. 


Let’s get to it. 


##Why B2B Sales KPIs Matter
Key performance indicators are important because they set your company’s direction for growth. They’re the bedrock on which you define goals, measure progress, align your team's strategic activities, and make critical business decisions. 


KPIs are not performance targets themselves. Rather, they’re the metrics used to label your targets and measure progress towards them. The target is the specific goal you're aiming for while the associated KPI tells you if you’re on track to achieve it. 


For example, you set a target of achieving a 20% lead-to-customer conversion rate by the end of Q4. In this case, 20% by the end of Q4 is the target while lead-to-customer conversions is the KPI. 



You might be wondering what the difference between KPIs and other metrics is. The clue is in the word “key.” KPIs are metrics considered fundamental to the success and high-level goals of your business. 


Many other metrics focus on tactical and operational processes. For example, your website bounce rate or email open rate are both important metrics, but they’re not key indicators of your company’s overall health. 


Tracking KPIs gives you a basis for identifying strengths and weaknesses in your strategic approach to growth and determining whether or not your goals are realistic. You can use this understanding to make data-backed decisions likely to lead to improvements. 


In addition, sales KPIs are incredibly useful for fostering accountability and motivation in your sales team. Nothing energizes a sales time like KPIs on track to meet targets. Equally, subpar performance creates a clear context for identifying areas of weakness and inefficiency.  


##12 Important B2B Sales KPIs to Track 

###1. Sales Activity and Outreach 
- 
Definition: Activity KPIs measure the number of actions a sales team makes in a particular area, such as volume of cold calls dialed or email follow-ups sent. They contrast with sales performance metrics because they do not track specific outcomes. 


- 
Why it matters: While sales activity and outreach KPIs don’t measure performance directly, they’re still important because they indicate the overall efficiency of a sales team and act as a basis for setting realistic performance goals. When you know how many actions your sales team is completing, you can better determine appropriate outcomes. “Increase cold sales calls in America and Canada by 20% over 12 months” is an example of a goal based on an activity KPI. 


- 
Examples: Cold emails sent, calls dialed, demos given, meetings booked, and proposals generated. 


Measuring sales activities can quickly become confusing. One way of staying organized is to use an AI sales development representative (SDR) to ensure all activity is logged and available in a single place. 


Artisan has an AI SDR called Ava, and she can track all sales activity within the platform. [Get in touch today](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing) to see how Ava can help you track all your key sales activities with practically no manual input. 


###2. Sales-Qualified Leads by Source 
- 
Definition: Sales-qualified leads by source measures the volume of interested leads that come from specific sales and marketing channels. 


- 
Why it matters: Tracking new sales-qualified leads by source tells you which of your marketing channels is most effective at generating high-quality leads. Some channels will provide large volumes of low-quality leads while others will generate low volumes of high-quality leads. By measuring sales-qualified leads—leads who have moved some way down your sales funnel and are likely to buy—you can identify those channels that effectively drive both quantity and quality and leverage them further. 


- 
Examples: Track the volume of sales-qualified leads by source across all your channels: email marketing, social media, search engine traffic, paid online and offline advertising, referrals, affiliate marketing, events and joint ventures. 


###3. Average Lead Response Time (Speed to Lead)
- 
Definition: Your average lead response time (also called speed to lead) measures the average time it takes you to respond to a lead once they’ve contacted your company (by filling out a web form or ending an enquiry email, for example). 


- 
Why it matters: The faster you can reach out to leads, the more likely they are to convert. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/10/step-by-step-guide-to-following-up-with-b2b-leads-generated-by-sdrs/?sh=45eb93cf2309) reports that you’re 100 times more likely to successfully contact a lead if you follow up in under five minutes. If you can reduce your average lead response time, you’ll see gains across other baseline KPIs like sales and revenue.


- 
Formula: Average lead response time = Total time taken to respond to leads / Number of leads



###4. Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) Conversion Rate
- 
Definition: Your MQL-to-SQL rate measures the percentage of leads transitioning from marketing-qualified leads to sales-qualified leads. 


- 
Why it matters: Sales teams use different lead-scoring methods to define MQLs and SQLs. However, in all cases the distinction points to levels of interest. An MQL has shown enough interest in your company to be considered likely to buy. An SQL has moved through part of your sales funnel and is considered highly likely to buy. Your MQL-to-SQL strategy indicates the efficacy of your lead nurturing process. A low percentage may point to the fact that your sales team is not engaging adequately with leads generated and their approach needs improving. 


- 
Formula: Marketing-qualified leads (MQL) to sales-qualified leads (SQL) conversion rate = (Total Number of SQLs / Total number of MQLs) x 100



###5. Qualified Lead to Customer Conversion Rate (Sales Close Rate)
- 
Definition: Your lead to customer conversion rate measures how many of your qualified leads are converting to customers. Unlike your MQL-to-SQL rate, it tracks the performance of your whole sales funnel, from early stage marketing to the moment a lead signs on the dotted line (or hits that “Pay Now” button). 


- 
Why it matters: Your lead to customer conversion rate measures the success of your sales funnel at a very high level. Unlike more specific KPIs that measure individual stages of your funnel, your lead conversion rate gives an overall indicator of the health of your “engine.” Boosting your lead conversion rate will directly impact your revenue and profitability. Qualified leads in this sense encompass both marketing and sales qualified leads. 


- 
Formula: Lead conversion rate = (Number of new customers / Number of qualified leads) x 100



One of the best ways of increasing your lead conversion rate is to use detailed ideal customer profiles (ICPs) based on up-to-date data. 


Artisan’s AI SDR Ava has a database of over 300 million potential leads from which she can target your ICP, all on autopilot. [Get in touch now](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing) to see how Artisan can help you meet your sales targets. 


###6. Sales Win Rate (Closed-Won Opportunities) 
- 
Definition: Your sales win rate measures your closed won opportunities against all closed opportunities (closed won opportunities and closed opportunities that didn’t result in a sale). 


- 
Why it matters: Your sales win rate shows you how many leads have converted to customers out of all leads who have completed the sales cycle. Closed-lost leads have given a definite “no” to your offer or been deemed inactive. This KPI is different to your lead to customer conversion rate or sales close rate because it illustrates how well your sales team is converting leads they’ve actively engaged with into customers. A poor month-by-month lead to customer conversion rate and a high sales win rate may indicate that your sales team is struggling to connect with all leads and many are remaining as open opportunities. 


- 
Formula: Win rate = (Closed-won leads / (Closed-won leads + closed-lost leads)) x 100



###7. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) 
- 
Definition: Your customer acquisition cost tells you how much it costs to gain a new customer. 


- 
Why it matters: Reducing your customer acquisition cost increases revenue. If the cost of acquiring a customer is reducing over time, it indicates that your marketing and sales team are becoming more efficient, either because of streamlined processes, more effective sales techniques, or the identification of appropriate marketing channels. 


- 
Formula: Customer acquisition cost = Total expenditure on sales and marketing / Number of new customers



###8. Pipeline Velocity
- 
Definition: Your pipeline velocity, also called sales velocity, measures the speed at which sales-qualified leads become customers. It’s calculated as revenue per quarter—for example, $100,000/quarter, which represents $100,000 in closed deals over a quarter. 


- 
Why it matters: Pipeline velocity measures the efficiency of your later-stage sales funnel and allows you to make revenue forecasts. A low Pipeline velocity may suggest that your sales team is experiencing operational difficulties or their sales techniques could be improved. A higher pipeline velocity means a better return on investment (ROI) for your sales budget. 


- 
Formula: Pipeline velocity = (Number of sales-qualified leads x average deal value x win rate) / (Length of sales cycle / 91 (days in a business quarter))



###9.  Customer Retention
- 
Definition: Your customer retention rate measures the percentage of customers who stay with you over a given period. It’s closely related to churn rate, which measures the number of customers who leave over the same period. 


- 
Why it matters: Your ability to hold onto customers directly impacts your revenue. It costs [four to five times as much](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/12/12/customer-retention-versus-customer-acquisition/) to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one. In essence, a high customer retention rate means that your customers are happy and you are effectively building loyalty and long-term satisfaction. This also creates upsell and cross-selling opportunities for you. 


- 
Formula: Customer retention rate = (Number customers at end of period - number of customers acquired during period) / Number of customers at start of period



###10. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) 
- 
Definition: Customer lifetime value measures the amount of money a customer will spend with you over their lifetime. This can be quite a tricky KPI to calculate because you need enough data to accurately determine the average length of time a customer remains active in addition to their order value and purchase frequency. 


- 
Why it matters: Customer lifetime value tracks three important sales metrics in combination: the average time a customer remains active, how often they make a purchase, and the average value of the purchases they make. It’s a full snapshot of the value of your typical customer. If it’s increasing, it means that you’re providing value, building strong customer relationships, and driving up your average deal size. 


- 
Formula: Customer lifetime value = Average order value x Purchase frequency x Customer Lifetime



###11. Sales Growth Rate
- 
Definition: Your sales growth rate measures the volume of sales in your most recent period compared with the previous period. It’s one of the most important growth metrics for a company. 


- 
Why it matters: Your sales growth rate is one of the strongest—if not the strongest—measure of your company’s overall growth. If you’re seeing a steady rise in sales growth, it is likely that your sales team is becoming more efficient, the number of deals is increasing, and marketing efforts are going well.


- 
Formula: Sales growth rate = ((Sales in most recent period - Sales in previous period) / Sales in the previous period) x 100



###12. Sales Revenue 
- 
Definition: Sales revenue is a straightforward KPI that looks at the raw revenue from sales over a given period. 


- 
Why it matters: Sales revenue is distinct from turnover. For many companies, sales revenue alone makes up total turnover, but this is not always the case. Where other sources, like investment returns, asset sales, subsidies and so on, contribute to turnover, it’s important to differentiate. Month-on-month or year-on-year sales revenue is a useful KPI for measuring long-term sustainable growth. 


- 
Formula: Sales revenue = Number of sales x Average sale value



##Strategies to Set B2B Sales KPIs for Success 
Now we’ve covered the KPIs, let’s look at how to pick the perfect mix to generate new leads and fill your sales pipeline so it’s overflowing with B2B goodness. 


###1. Select the Right KPIs 
- 
Align with business goals. Top-tier sales KPIs should align with executive goals which then “cascade” down your organization in the form of more specific KPIs. For example, you may decide on a high-level company goal to double sales revenue. Sales managers may then use pipeline velocity as the KPI to measure movement towards this goal and individual sales reps may be tracked against outreach activity KPIs. 



- 
Analyze historical data. Analyzing historical data helps you create forecasts that can act as the basis of realistic goals and relevant KPIs. Historical data can also highlight missed opportunities for immediate results. 


- 
Prioritize actionable metrics. Use the SMART framework to pick KPIs and sales metrics that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. 



- 
Benchmark against industry standards. Industry standards are widely available, with reputable sources like Gartner, McKinsey, and Forresster often publishing industry-specific benchmarks. Ultimately, your in-house data should be your main guide, but third-party insights have their place. 


- 
Consult stakeholders. Involve all decision-makers across your organization to ensure alignment with high-level KPIs. Consider stakeholder mapping to ensure alignment with company-wide goals and specific metrics. 


###2. Keep it Simple, Clear, and Measurable 
Choose KPIs that are relevant to different stages of your sales funnel and well-suited to your existing sales processes. Focus on a core set of sales KPIs that are likely to provide the most valuable insights and help you leverage the most prominent growth opportunities. 


Wherever possible, use automation tools to streamline the collection and analysis of data so that you can measure KPIs in real time in a way that is clear and coherent to the whole sales team. 


###3. Track Progress Regularly and Adjust 
KPIs are dynamic, fluid metrics. Track progress and make adjustments at both the tactical and strategic level as needed. This ensures your chosen KPIs remain relevant and aligned with broad business goals and that team performance stays at an optimal level.


Here are some ideas for adjusting your approach:


- 
Refine lower-tier metrics  


- 
Update performance benchmarks


- 
Explore ways to improve data quality  


- 
Add greater detail to reporting  


- 
Explore possible automations 


- 
Gather qualitative feedback feedback  


- 
Adjust timeframes based on sales performance


- 
Test and integrate new tools 


- 
Realignment incentives where appropriate



In addition, it’s important to ensure that your whole team is involved in the brainstorming process, as they will often have insights into both the best sales opportunities and where sales strategies are experiencing issues and bottlenecks. 


###4. Embrace New Technology 
Stay up-to-date on new data analytics tools and other software to assist with tracking B2B sales KPIs. One of the most straightforward ways of optimizing your team’s sales performance is by using AI-driven automation tools, many of which sync with your main sales CRM.


Boost your sales with Artisan's data-driven outreach optimization. Our platform analyzes response rates across campaigns, refining your strategy for maximum conversion. [Book a demo](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales/) to discover how Artisan can help you exceed targets.


##Wrapping It Up: KPIs as Keys to Growth
KPIs are fundamental to your whole business strategy. Pick the wrong ones, and you could be committing to months and even years of subpar growth and internal misalignment.


However, if you can identify KPIs that fit the broader vision of your company—whether that’s fast growth, a hyper-loyal fanbase, or a dominant presence on your primary sales channels—you’re priming your company for success. 


Even better, when your chosen KPIs suit the unique strengths of your sales reps, they’re near-guaranteed to boost team performance and drive morale. 


Add a layer of automation and AI-driven productivity by taking advantage of the array of powerful tools now at your disposal, and you’ll be hitting those targets faster than you can say “sales."

If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.



The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:


- 
Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about [withdrawing your consent](#what_are_your_privacy_rights?).


- 
Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.


- 
Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.

In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller"under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor"on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller"responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.



If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.



We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,implied consent). You can [withdraw your consent](#what_are_your_privacy_rights?) at any time.



In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:


- 
If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way


- 
For investigations and fraud detection and prevention


- 
For business transactions provided certain conditions are met


- 
If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim

If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse


- 
If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province


- 
If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records


- 
If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced


- 
If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes


- 
If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.,phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.



We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
